But arguments about whether the limit should be 60% of GDP or more miss a larger point.
Nineteen years of experience with the Maastricht Treaty, which created both the EU and the euro, has shown convincingly that such limits are unenforceable.
Countries with the clout to flaunt the limits will do so whenever it is politically convenient.
And, if a debt crisis is near, exceptions will be found, waivers will be issued, and buyers for the additional debt will be lined up.
So the question is not what to do when debt gets near its limit, however high or low.
It is how to prevent debt from getting near that limit in the first place, except in very extreme and unusual circumstances.
And for that, you need fiscal rules.
A fiscal rule is any pre-specified mechanism that constrains spending or the deficit.
According to a study by the International Monetary Fund, 80 countries around the world use some kind of fiscal rule.
But not all fiscal rules are created equal.
If too loose, a rule is merely ornamental.
If too tight – a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, for example – the rule could create rather than solve problems: think of the economic and political chaos that would ensue if Spain, with unemployment at 21%, were forced to eliminate its huge fiscal deficit overnight.
Sweden and Chile are almost poles apart geographically, but both have used sophisticated fiscal rules successfully.
Chile sets a target for its cyclically-adjusted fiscal balance – that is, the balance that emerges after accounting for the deviations in commodity prices and domestic output from their trends.
When commodity prices boomed in the middle of the last decade, the rule called for huge budget surpluses – which Chile achieved, repaying almost all of its public debt and accumulating a sizable rainy-day fund.
When the financial crisis came, Chile was able to mount an aggressive fiscal stimulus without so much as a hiccup from financial markets.
Of course, no fiscal rule can account for all contingencies.
That is why you need an independent fiscal council to administer it, just as you need an independent central bank to pursue an inflation-targeting monetary rule.
Agreeing on the composition of such a council for Europe would be hard, but no harder than it was to agree on the makeup of the ECB’s board.
Eurobonds plus fiscal rules: this formula is the euro’s best hope for salvation.
Unfortunately, another crisis or two might be necessary before European leaders consider it seriously.
Europe’s Easy-Money Endgame
MUNICH – The euro has brought a balance-of-payments crisis to Europe, just as the gold standard did in the 1920s.
In fact, there is only one difference between the two episodes: During today’s crisis, huge international rescue packages have been available.
These rescue packages have relieved the eurozone’s financial distress, but at a high cost.
Not only have they enabled investors to avoid paying for their poor decisions; they have also given overpriced southern European countries the opportunity to defer real depreciation in the form of a reduction of relative prices of goods.
This is necessary to restore the competitiveness that was destroyed in the euro’s initial years, when it caused excessive inflation.
Indeed, for countries like Greece, Portugal, or Spain, regaining competitiveness would require them to lower the prices of their own products relative to the rest of the eurozone by about 30%, compared to the beginning of the crisis.
Italy probably needs to reduce its relative prices by 10-15%.
But Portugal and Italy have so far failed to deliver any such “real depreciation,” while relative prices in Greece and Spain have fallen by only 8% and 6%, respectively.
Revealingly, of all the crisis countries, only Ireland managed to turn the corner.
The reason is obvious: its bubble already burst at the end of 2006, before any rescue funds were available.
Ireland was on its own, so it had no option but to implement massive austerity measures, reducing its product prices relative to other eurozone countries by 13% from peak to trough.
Today, Ireland’s unemployment rate is falling dramatically, and its manufacturing sector is booming.
In relative terms, Greece received most of Europe’s bailout money and showed the largest increase in unemployment.
The official loans granted to the country by the European Central Bank and the international community have increased more than sixfold during the past five years, from €53 billion ($58 billion) in February 2010 to €324 billion, or 181% of GDP, now.
Nevertheless, the unemployment rate has more than doubled, from 11% to 26%.
There are four possible economic and policy responses to this state of affairs.
First, Europe could become a transfer union, with the north giving more and more credit to the south and later waiving it.
Second, the south can deflate.
Third, the north can inflate.
And, fourth, countries that are no longer competitive can exit Europe’s monetary union and depreciate their new currency.
Each path is associated with serious complications.
The first creates a permanent dependence on transfers, which, by sustaining relative prices, prevents the economy from regaining competitiveness.
The second path drives many debtors in crisis countries into bankruptcy.
The third expropriates the creditor countries of the north.
And the fourth may cause contagion effects via capital markets, possibly forcing policymakers to introduce capital controls, as in Cyprus in 2013.
European politics has focused so far on providing public credit to the crisis countries at near-zero interest rates, which eventually may morph into transfers.
But now the ECB is attempting to break the impasse through quantitative easing (QE).
The ECB’s stated goal is to reflate the eurozone, thereby reducing the euro’s external value, by purchasing more than €1.1 trillion worth of assets.
According to ECB President Mario Draghi, the inflation rate, which currently stands at just below 0%, is to be raised to an average of just below 2%.
This would offer southern European countries a way out of their competitiveness trap, because if prices remained unchanged in the south, while the northern countries inflated, the southern countries could gradually reduce their goods’ relative prices without feeling too much pain.
Of course, in that case the north needs to inflate faster than by just 2%.
If, say, southern Europe kept its inflation rate at 0% and France inflated at a rate of 1%, Germany would have to inflate by a good 4%, and the rest of the eurozone at 2% annually, to reach a eurozone average of slightly less than 2%.
This pattern would have to continue for about ten years to bring the eurozone back into balance.
At that point, Germany’s price level would be about 50% higher than it is today.
I do expect QE to bring about some inflation.
Given that an exchange rate is the relative price of a currency, as more euros come into circulation, their value has to fall substantially to establish a new equilibrium in the currency market.
Experience with similar programs in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan has shown that QE unleashes powerful forces of depreciation.
QE in the eurozone will thus bring about the inflation that Draghi wants via higher import and export prices.
Whether this effect will be sufficient to revitalize southern Europe remains to be seen.
There is a risk that Japan, China, and the US will not sit on their hands while the euro loses value, with the world possibly even sliding into a currency war.
Moreover, the southern EU countries, instead of leaving prices unchanged, could abandon austerity and issue an ever greater volume of new bonds to stimulate the economy.
Competitiveness gains and rebalancing would fail to materialize, and, after an initial flash in the pan, the eurozone would return to permanent crisis.
The euro, finally and fully discredited, would then meet a very messy end.
One can only hope that this scenario does not come to pass, and that the southern countries stay the course of austerity.
This is their last chance.
Europe, America, and the Drumbeat of War with Iran
America’s capital is once again abuzz with talk of war, not only of the latest “strategy for victory” in Iraq, but now also of military action against Iran.
The harder it becomes to discern any rationality in the Bush administration’s actions, the louder the rumor mill grinds.
Will Bush order an air and Special Forces attack on Iran?
Ever since Bush’s State of the Union address at the end of January, hardly a day has passed without something happening in connection with Iran or without the Bush administration’s ratcheting up its rhetoric.
Clearly, the US is also pressing ahead with preparations for an air strike.
(A more extensive military commitment is scarcely possible, given how overstretched US ground forces already are.)
Indeed, the confrontation with the Iranians in Iraq is visibly intensifying, and it may be gathering strength elsewhere as well.
A bomb directed at the Iranian Revolutionary Guard recently exploded on Iran’s border with Afghanistan.
And there are, of course, new attempts by the United States to drum up “evidence” of an Iranian threat that may justify an attack.
Is this all a bluff?
The world could perhaps calmly wait for an answer, but for the fact that the progress of Iran’s nuclear program and the approaching end of President Bush’s term might create an incalculable dynamic of its own.
As with Iraq, America’s strength may be enough to start a war, but not to win it.
But the consequences of a military adventure in Iran would far surpass those of the war in Iraq.
Doing things by halves yet again in the Middle East would be the worst of all possible options – bad for the region and bad for its neighbors.
The first among the neighbors affected would be Europe.
So how has Europe, with its vital security interests at stake, responded to these developments?
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has already adapted to the US administration’s new confrontational rhetoric.
French President Jacques Chirac unguardedly speculated that an Iran with one or two nuclear bombs might not pose a serious a threat, given the possibility of nuclear retaliation &#45;&#45; his musings so startled French officials that they quickly jumped in to correct the President’s comments.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel gives speeches at security conferences that find favor in America, but otherwise Germany prefers to stay in the background.
Across Europe, risk avoidance seems to be the order of the day, even at the expense of the common interest and NATO solidarity.
The German navy is defending the Lebanese coast against Hezbollah, while other European nations bear the brunt of policing Lebanon on the ground.
In Afghanistan, Germany, with its strong military presence in the north, has been turning a deaf ear to calls for help from the Canadian allies fighting a revived Taliban in the south.
Germany now wants to send some Tornado jets for reconnaissance purposes – better than nothing, but not by much.
In terms of security policy, Europe is stagnating, if not regressing, at the very moment when unity is needed more then ever.
The Big Three of Europe – and Germany, as the current EU president in particular – must find a way to act together in strategic security matters.
If they don’t, Europe will largely cease to matter when the going gets rough.
And the going is now getting quite rough in Iran and the Persian Gulf.
Should Iran be attacked this year, the consequences will be borne first and foremost by the region, but also by Europe as the Middle East’s immediate western neighbor – and they will be felt for a long time to come.
Indeed, Europe will have to share the costs if Iran prevails and becomes a nuclear power.
So there is much at stake for the old continent.
To be precise, two overriding EU security interests are at stake: avoiding a war with Iran and preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear power.
These two apparently contradictory interests can be reconciled and translated into a common strategy by adopting a three-pronged approach based on efficient isolation, effective containment, and direct negotiations.
The Europeans – led by Merkel, Blair, and Chirac – should agree to assure the US that Europe is ready to pay a high, perhaps very high, economic price by taking decisive action to intensify the sanctions against Iran.
But they should offer this only on two strict preconditions: that the military option be taken off the table, and that all parties involved – including the US – enter into direct negotiations with Iran.
The policy of isolation coupled with direct negotiations would be strengthened further by a common strategy toward Syria, aimed not at “regime change,” but at “coalition change” – that is, drawing Syria away from its close alliance with Iran.
It was both right and important that the EU Council of Foreign Ministers agreed on sanctions against Iran.
Faced with the threat of financial sanctions, Iran’s political elite is increasingly realizing the price of its confrontational course.
It is imperative to further this process in a resolute manner, while at the same time rejecting military adventurism.
It is up to Europe to prevent the two worst developments in Iran – war and nuclear armament – by acting jointly and with determination.
Vital European and transatlantic interests are at stake.
It is thus Europe’s responsibility – and especially Germany’s, as the current EU president – to act now.
Europe Under Siege?
BRUSSELS – Many Europeans feel like their countries are under assault, as huge numbers of migrants flow across their borders.
Whether they are being exposed to refugees firsthand, or just seeing images of them splashed across newspaper pages, Europeans are well aware of the vast numbers of desperate people trying to enter European Union territory by any means possible.
But this awareness has yet to translate into a unified response.
Tensions among member states seem to be rising, perhaps because the problem differs so greatly across countries.
On a per capita basis, Sweden receives 15 times more asylum applications than the United Kingdom, where official policy toward refugees remains the most hostile.
Germany has now become the main destination overall, receiving nearly 40% of the EU total; even on a per capita basis, this is several times more than the EU average.
Of course, there are clear rules about how responsibility for refugees is delineated: according to the so-called Dublin Regulation, the first EU member state into which a refugee crosses is responsible for that person’s asylum application.
But this is clearly problematic, as it puts the entire burden of refugees on the EU’s frontier countries.
Though this may not have been a huge problem in the 1990s, when EU countries received, in all, only 300,000 asylum applications annually, it cannot work in a year when the total is expected to be triple that number.
Smaller border countries like Hungary and Greece simply do not have the capacity to register and house hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers.
And larger countries like Italy have an incentive to overlook the large numbers of refugees landing on their shores, knowing that, if nothing is done, those refugees will likely head elsewhere (mainly to northern Europe).
Germany, recognizing that the Dublin system is untenable, has now decided to process all asylum applications from Syrians, regardless of where they crossed into the EU.
The decision was likely driven, at least partly, by how difficult it is, given the EU’s porous internal borders, to determine where a refugee first entered.
A 2013 ruling by the European Court of Justice that Germany could not return an Iranian refugee to Greece (where the applicant was found “to face a real risk of being subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment”) probably heightened Germany’s sense of responsibility on this issue.
Germany is the largest EU member country in terms of population and GDP; so, to some extent, it does make sense for it to take the lead.
But Germany still accounts for less than one-fifth of the EU’s population, and less than one-quarter of its economy.
In other words, not even Germany can handle all of Europe’s refugees today.
A few months ago, the European Commission tried its hand at resolving this problem with a courageous proposal to distribute refugees across member states according to a simple equation that accounts for population and GDP.
But the plan was rejected, with member states – particularly those with the fewest refugees – claiming that it represented an undue interference in domestic affairs.
This has put the EU in its usual quandary: everybody recognizes that there is a problem, but a solution requires unanimity, which cannot be achieved, because each country defends only its own interests.
The only way forward is to leave out the countries that are most averse to accepting immigrants, at least temporarily, and create a solution involving just those that are willing to share the burden.
This may not seem “fair,” but, with more refugees landing on Europe’s borders every day, EU leaders cannot afford to delay action.
But there is another dimension to the crisis that makes addressing it all the more complicated.
The migrants are not all from conflict areas like Syria, and thus do not, according to international law, have a “right to asylum.”
There are also plenty of economic migrants from, say, the poorer parts of the Balkans, hoping to escape poverty at home – and willing to misuse the asylum system in the process.
Lodging an application, even one without any chance of being accepted, is appealing, because until it is rejected, the applicant receives basic housing, social services (including health care), and pocket money in an amount that may well exceed wages in his or her home country.
Spending a few months in northern Europe while an asylum application is processed is far more attractive than going home to a job that pays a barely livable wage, or to no job at all.
As the number of asylum-seekers increases, so does the time it takes to process their applications, making the system all the more tempting for economic migrants.
And, indeed, close to half of all asylum-seekers in Germany now come from safe countries, like Serbia, Albania, or Macedonia.
As Europe’s populists use such cases of “welfare tourism” to sow fear and anger among the European public, reaching an agreement to accommodate actual refugees becomes increasingly difficult.
Against this background, the EU needs to take action on two fronts.
First, member countries must urgently boost their capacity to deal with asylum applications, so that they can quickly identify those who deserve protection.
Second, the EU needs to improve burden sharing – ideally among all countries, but perhaps among a smaller group at first – in providing shelter for those who gain asylum.
International law – and basic morality – demands nothing less.
Turning Off the Dividend Spigot
NEW YORK – European banks’ high litigation and restructuring costs have resulted in major losses on their books and abysmal stock-market performance.
As the industry and European regulators now reflect on this dismal state of affairs and search for solutions, they should consider banks’ revenue distribution – including employee bonuses and shareholder dividends – as part of the problem.
Revenue distribution is one primary reason for European banks’ capital shortfalls.
To understand why, we should look back to October 2014, when the European Banking Authority began balance-sheet stress tests for the eurozone’s largest 123 banks and found a capital shortfall of €25 billion ($28 billion) in all of them.
At the time, the EBA required the banks to devise plans to address their respective shortfalls within 6-9 months.
Some banks took action and raised equity through rights issues, sometimes with substantial help from governments.
But most banks mollified regulators by simply shedding riskier assets to improve their capital ratios.
Needless to say, these efforts were ineffective, and European banks’ share prices have declined by 50%, on average, since the initial 2014 assessment.
Banks that failed the stress test and didn’t take the result seriously are partly to blame, but so, too, are regulators who did not sufficiently hold the banks’ feet to the fire to improve their balance sheets, and who may have applied stress tests that were too weak to detect financial frailty.
The EBA conducted another series of stress tests and reported the results in late July.
This latest round looked at 51 banks and, contrary to previous tests, was not designed to identify capital shortfalls, but rather to provide “a common analytical framework to consistently compare and assess the resilience of large EU banks to adverse economic developments.”
Regulators now suppose that the European banking sector is resilient to adverse shocks.
On the same day as the EBA’s announcement, the worst performer, Italy’s Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, announced €5 billion ($5.6 billion) in new funding, pursuant to its €5.6 billion capital requirement.
Still, market reaction to the announcement was negative (the EuroStoxx Banks index fell 7.5% in two days), most likely because the EBA did not include specific estimates of European banks’ capital shortfalls or outline a recapitalization plan.
In a new paper investigating this market reaction, using United States capital-requirement rules, we calculate the total capital shortfall in all 51 participating banks to be €123 billion.
Despite this large capital shortfall, 28 of the 34 publicly listed banks in the stress test paid out about €40 billion in dividends for 2015, meaning that they distributed, on average, over 60% of their earnings to shareholders.
Dividend payments made by under-capitalized banks amount to a substantial wealth transfer from subordinated bondholders to shareholders, because it is bondholders who will suffer the losses in a crisis.
Moreover, it is potentially a wealth transfer from taxpayers to private shareholders, because under new banking rules government bailouts are possible after bondholders have covered (bailed in) 8% of a bank’s equity and liabilities.
By contrast, undercapitalized banks in the US are forced to halt all forms of capital distribution if they fail a stress test.
Fortunately, following the 2016 round of stress tests, the EBA is now also considering this type of regulatory sanction.
Thus, “competent authorities may also consider requesting changes to the institutions’ capital plan,” which “may take a number of forms such as potential restrictions on dividends required for a bank to maintain the agreed trajectory of its capital planning in the adverse scenario.”
We estimate that if European regulators had adopted this approach and forced banks to stop paying dividends in 2010 – the start of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe – the retained equity could have paid for more than 50% of the 2016 capital shortfalls.
The figure above shows our calculated capital shortfalls, using the EBA stress test’s “adverse scenario” losses and the cumulative dividends these banks have distributed since 2010.
Dividends paid out by some banks, such as BNP Paribas and Barclays, actually exceed the current capital shortfalls, while at others – such as Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, and Société Générale – capital shortfalls far exceed dividends that would have been retained.
The latter banks would still require substantial capital issuances on top of dividend restrictions to make up the difference.
Nonetheless, our findings suggest a simple first step toward preventing bank capital erosion: stop banks with capital shortfalls from paying dividends (including internal dividends such as employee bonuses).
Such a policy would not even require regulators to broach topics like capital issuance, bailouts, or bail-ins, and some banks have even already begun to suspend dividend payments.
All that’s left now is for the European Central Bank to enforce this practice across the eurozone.
A New Year’s Banking Union
BRUSSELS – Five years after the outbreak of the financial crisis, Europe’s economic and political situation remains fragile.
A mild recession is expected in Europe this year, and unemployment is on the rise.
Beyond deficit reduction, we need to implement a €120 billion ($155 billion) European investment plan, and deepen the European Single Market to unleash its growth potential.
But we also need other structural measures.
The European Union must put an end to the negative feedback loop between individual member states and their national banking systems.
Between 2008 and 2011, EU taxpayers granted banks €4.5 trillion in loans and guarantees.
In some countries, the threat of bank recapitalization with public funds has resulted in a drop in market confidence and a huge rise in interest rates.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has taken decisive action to break this vicious circle.
Moreover, there is now a consensus that the 17 eurozone countries need a banking union to accompany their common currency.
The European Commission has proposed a single rulebook for banks’ capital requirements; mutual support between national deposit guarantee schemes; and Europe-wide rules for resolving failing banks that place the main burden on bank shareholders and creditors, not on taxpayers.
On June 29, European heads of state and government committed themselves to the creation of a single European supervisor for banks in the eurozone.
This is good news for both financial stability and public finances: once the single supervisor is in place, supervision will be more credible and impartial, which is important for dealing with ailing banks and managing their return to viability.
The European Commission also put forward a set of legislative proposals to establish the single supervisory mechanism and confer key supervisory tasks on the ECB.
This proposal must now be amended and approved as soon as possible by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers if we are to have a chance of activating the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and proceeding with the other essential pillars of a banking union.
Further work, however, is still needed in several areas:
The scope of the new supervisory mechanism.
Some member states favor restricting European supervision to systemically important banks.
But the Commission believes that it should cover all 6,000 banks in the eurozone.
After all, “systemically important" is impossible to define.
The failures of banks like Northern Rock, Dexia, and Bankia are reminders that small and medium-size banks can endanger the entire financial system.
And it would be inherently unstable to have two supervisory mechanisms for banks operating in the same market.The participation of non-eurozone countries in the new supervisory scheme.
The Commission’s proposal confers powers on the ECB for the supervision of all banks in the eurozone.
For non-eurozone countries, the proposals provide for a mechanism to join on a voluntary basis and submit to the ECB’s authority.
But the EU treaties make it complicated to give these non-eurozone countries full voting powers.
I do not see any political problem with giving these countries a full voice in shaping the decisions of the European supervisor, but creativity will be needed to find a legally sound and fair solution.National supervisors’ role in the new system.
Clearly, the European Council has decided on a paradigm shift: powers are moving to the ECB.
But national supervisors will be members of the board that will take key decisions, which they will prepare and implement.
In the current negotiations, we can still fine-tune the roles of the European and national supervisors, but ultimate authority must rest with the ECB.Non-eurozone EU members that do not want to join the single supervisory mechanism.
These countries have expressed concerns about the new powers conferred on the ECB.
In particular, they question the ECB's voting rights within the European Banking Authority, which will remain in charge of developing a single rulebook for all 27 countries in the EU’s single market and enhancing convergence of supervisory practices.
We need to find ways to preserve fully the influence of non-eurozone countries within the European Banking Authority.Democratic accountability for the ECB’s new supervisory powers.
The ECB must, of course, maintain its full monetary-policy independence, despite its new role.
So a key question is how, in addition to giving an important role to the European Parliament, national parliaments can play their part in overseeing supervisory decisions.Timing.
According to some EU countries, the Commission’s proposal is too ambitious to enter into force at the beginning of 2013.
But an effective single banking supervisor is a prerequisite for the ESM’s direct recapitalization of banks.
Only with this possibility and strong unified supervision will Europe be in a position to break the vicious circle between banks’ balance-sheet weakness and sovereign debt, and thus resolve the eurozone crisis.Entry into force in January 2013 would bring about supervision by the ECB of banks that have received or requested public funding.
Only in July 2013 would all banks of major systemic importance be subject to ECB supervision.
The remaining banks would be subject to the new mechanism at the start of 2014.
Intense discussions are normal for such a high-stakes project.
Countries like Germany, Finland, and the Netherlands are right to argue that rapid progress cannot come at the expense of the new supervisory structure’s quality.
But EU countries have to stick to the commitment that they made in June and strike a deal in time for a gradual entry into force in January 2013.
Europe’s Emerging Bubbles
MUNICH – The European Central Bank’s latest policy moves have shocked many observers.
While the goal – to prevent deflation and spur growth – is clear, the policies themselves are setting the stage for severe instability.
The policies in question include setting the interest rate on the ECB’s main refinancing operations to zero; raising monthly asset purchases by €20 billion ($22.3 billion) to €80 billion; and pushing the interest rate on money that banks deposit with the ECB further into negative territory – to -0.40%.
The inflationary credit bubble spurred in southern European countries by the persistence of lower interest rates undermined their competitiveness and drove asset and property prices to unsustainably high levels.
When the bubble burst, the ECB tried to prevent the excessive prices from returning to their equilibrium levels by using its printing press and promising unlimited coverage to investors. The latest ECB measures are just more of the same.
Of course, when the financial crisis erupted in full force in 2008, following the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, the ECB’s interventions were justified.
But after the global economy started to recover during the latter part of the following year, the ECB’s moves became increasingly problematic, because they enabled countries to evade structural reform and hindered the necessary disinflation in the southern eurozone countries – or even halted it altogether, as in Portugal and Italy.
Southern Europe had succumbed to the drug of cheap credit.
But when private credit stalled and the symptoms of withdrawal began to appear, the ECB provided replacement drugs.
Instead of treating the addiction, it created junkie economies that were unable to function without a fix.
Japan made a similar mistake when its property bubble burst in 1990.
For over two decades, the Bank of Japan flooded the economy with money at near-zero interest rates.
The Japanese government, for its part, has followed such a relentless policy of deficit spending that public debt jumped from 67% of GDP to 246% of GDP today, with the latest upward push provided by the dubious “Abenomics” economic strategy being pursued by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government.
None of this has helped, because neither monetary nor fiscal policy can substitute for structural reform.
On the contrary, the more Keynesian and monetarist drugs are administered, the feebler the self-healing power of the markets and the weaker the willingness of policymakers to impose painful detoxification treatments on the economy and populace.
But the worst effects of the ECB policy may be yet to come, if the eurozone’s still-sound economies also become credit junkies.
There are already some worrying signs of this.
Property markets in Austria, Germany, and Luxembourg have practically exploded throughout the crisis, as a result of banks chasing borrowers with offers of loans at near-zero interest rates, regardless of their creditworthiness.
In Austria, property prices have risen by nearly half since the Lehman collapse; in Luxembourg, they have risen by almost one-third.
Even Germany, Europe’s largest economy, has been experiencing a massive property boom since 2010, with average urban property prices having risen by more than one-third – and by nearly half in large cities.
The country is undergoing a construction boom not seen since reunification.
Real estate agents have only leftovers on offer.
The German property boom could be reined in with an appropriate jump in interest rates.
But, given the ECB’s apparent determination to head in the opposite direction, the bubble will only grow.
If it bursts, the effects could be dire for the euro; the new Euro-skeptic Alternative for Germany party, which made astonishing headway in the country’s recent state elections, would make sure of that.
The Eurozone’s Minsky Conundrum
BRUSSELS – Stubbornly low inflation has the European Central Bank worried.
But its response – essentially just more quantitative easing – could backfire, exacerbating imbalances and generating serious financial instability.
As it stands, the headline consumer price index in the eurozone hovers around zero, and even core inflation remains below 1% – too far for comfort from the ECB’s target of around 2%.
While a new round of weakness in global commodity prices earlier this year contributed to these figures, it does not explain the weakness in longer-term inflation expectations, which have improved little since March, when the ECB started its massive €60 billion ($66.3 billion) per month bond-buying program.
But instead of rethinking its strategy, the ECB is considering doubling down: buying even more bonds and lowering its benchmark interest rate even further into negative territory. This would be a serious mistake.
Easier credit conditions and lower interest rates are supposed to boost growth by stimulating investment and consumption demand.
But in the core of the eurozone – countries like Germany and the Netherlands – credit has been plentiful, and interest rates have been close to zero for some time, so there was never much chance that bond purchases would have a significant impact there.
And, indeed, the European Commission’s most recent economic forecast shows that spending in the core countries has not increased as a result of the ECB’s policies; Germany’s external surplus is actually increasing.
Of course, in the highly indebted peripheral countries, there was room for interest rates to fall and for credit supply to grow – and they have, leading governments and households to increase their spending.
While the asymmetrical impact of the ECB’s policy is appropriate in principle (because unemployment is much higher in the periphery), the reality is that a recovery supported by the least solvent economies is not sustainable.
Back in 1986, Hyman Minsky warned about the longer-term dangers to financial stability if “Ponzi” borrowers – those who can service their debt only with new debt – become the main pillar of the economy.
A zero-interest-rate environment is of course ideal for such borrowers, because there is nothing to provide an indication of solvency; borrowers can just roll over their debt.
But it is bad for those with a strong asset position; by reducing their spending power, it spurs them to save even more.
The standard response to Minsky’s concern – that the spenders can’t afford it and the savers aren’t spending – is that monetary policy should focus on ensuring price stability, while macroprudential policy aims to safeguard financial stability by limiting borrowing by highly indebted agents.
But this approach does not work.
If macroprudential policy limited additional credit to marginal borrowers effectively, monetary policy would have no impact on demand (as long as the most solvent agents refuse to spend more).
This problem arose in the United States after the 2001 recession.
Although the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low for a protracted period, the corporate sector did not increase its investment.
The recovery was ultimately fueled by so-called “subprime” mortgages: home-purchase loans extended to borrowers with lower credit ratings.
The result, as we know, was a mega-bubble that triggered the 2008 financial crisis.
In the eurozone’s case, the risk is compounded by the ineffectiveness of its key macroprudential instrument, the Stability and Growth Pact, in limiting countries’ spending, as lower interest rates give debtor countries leeway to spend more.
Public debt as a share of GDP is on the rise in Italy and Spain, even though both countries, with their eurozone partners, have committed to reducing the debt ratio.
In fact, even without lower interest rates, the deficit limits that the Pact imposes have proved to be non-binding, exemplified by France’s flouting of them since 2009.
In short, monetary policy is perpetuating the disequilibrium between creditor and debtor economies in the eurozone, and macroprudential policy is doing nothing to stop it.
When interest rates normalize, this could generate serious financial instability.
But – and this is the conundrum – the ECB has few options for stimulating demand among the eurozone’s more solvent agents, and thus supporting a sustainable recovery.
In deciding its next move – whether to initiate more bond purchases, lower interest rates even further, or do both – the ECB must recognize that any positive impact on demand probably will be limited to the eurozone’s weaker economies – that is, the economies that can least afford it.
This is a high-risk move, one that is probably not justified by the effort to bring price increases a few dozen basis points closer to the ECB’s target.
A recovery has already begun in the eurozone. It should be left to run its course.
An even more expansionary monetary-policy stance might strengthen the recovery marginally, but at the cost of increasing the eurozone’s already-dangerous imbalances.
Europe’s Chimerical Capital-Markets Union
LONDON – The eurozone's survival is in doubt again, as Greece demands debt forgiveness and an end to austerity – or else.
But, though Europe's currency union is at risk, and its banking union remains at an early stage of development, the endlessly creative European Commission is embarking on another adventure: a so-called “capital-markets union."
That “so-called" is appropriate, because the project, despite being only vaguely defined at this point, is most certainly not intended to create a single European capital market.
Indeed, European Union leaders know better than to announce such an ambition, which would require a new treaty – no one is prepared to open up that can of worms.
After all, European voters are in no mood to transfer more powers to Brussels.
The capital-markets union actually began as a slogan, coined by one of EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's acolytes.
Now, the new financial markets commissioner, the United Kingdom's Lord Jonathan Hill, has been assigned the unenviable task of putting flesh on bare bones.
The Commission's “Green Paper" consultation round on the subject produced more questions than answers.
Think tanks, lobby groups, and national regulators have wasted no time in trying to influence Hill's efforts, and to head off any initiatives that might damage their interests.
The Bank of England has argued that there should be no replication of the banking union grant of new powers to the European Central Bank at the expense of national central banks.
The capital-markets union, the BOE argues, “does not require institutional change," so no super-regulator should be created.
The Commission has accepted that conclusion for now, though one of Hill's aides has suggested that, “at some point…supervisory issues will pop up."
In fact, establishing a European version of the US Securities and Exchange Commission is a longstanding aim of the Brussels Eurocracy – one that may be achieved one day, but not just yet.
But before delving into institutional issues – a favorite topic of EU veterans – one should consider what problem the capital-markets union is supposed to solve.
And here, there is considerable agreement.
Most regulators and market participants agree that Europe's financial markets are dysfunctional.
With banking assets amounting to roughly 300% of EU-wide GDP, compared to some 70% in the United States, large pools of savings are being left unused.
Moreover, European companies receive an excessive 80% of their finance from banks and less than 20% from capital markets (the proportions are roughly reversed in the US).
The need to redress that imbalance has become increasingly evident since the recent financial crisis, as banks' efforts to rebuild their capital bases (and meet stricter regulatory requirements) has led to credit rationing.
Loosening that constraint on output growth would improve the European economy's resilience, encourage risk-taking, and promote dynamism.
The overall aim of the capital-markets union is thus relatively straightforward.
But achieving it is not – in no small part because Europe's heavy reliance on bank finance stems from structural and cultural factors.
And the remedies that the Commission has suggested so far – for example, encouraging crowdfunding and standardizing the terms of securitization – appear unlikely to promote rapid growth in non-bank finance.
Promoting a pan-European private placement market might help, as would aligning standards for covered bonds.
But both strategies would face serious legal obstacles.
Indeed, though Hill's modest initial agenda certainly would do no harm (and should be pursued as quickly as possible), any substantial measures beyond it would confront major roadblocks.
For example, harmonizing insolvency regimes across the continent and reducing tax incentives that favor debt over equity, while entirely logical, strike at the heart of member states' remaining sovereignty, and thus will be extremely difficult to push forward.
Some of the other ideas that Hill has floated, such as relaxing the capital standards for long-term investments, run counter to the EU solvency standards for insurers and pension funds that will be implemented next year.
Some old nags have also been dragged out of the stables for another run around the course.
“Streamlined" prospectuses and exemptions from some accounting standards for small companies have been tried before in individual countries – and have failed.
Looser standards for issuers weaken protection for investors, and there is evidence that lax regulation of new issues may reduce investor demand for them, raising the cost of finance.
Unless the political mood changes radically in Europe – an unlikely development – it would be unrealistic to expect the capital-markets union to be anywhere near as transformational as the banking union has been.
It will be, at best, a small disturbance, in which few national sacred cows are slaughtered.
What began as a slogan may turn out to be helpful.
But a capital-markets union is highly unlikely to end Europe's love affair with its banks.
The biggest impact on market structure will continue to come from ever-rising capital requirements, which will make bank credit more expensive and encourage borrowers to look elsewhere.
Europe’s Dog in the Nighttime
BRUSSELS – The new European Commission headed by Jean-Claude Juncker is off to a rocky start.
But one would not know it from reading the news headlines.
As Sherlock Holmes understood, a dog that does not bark in the nighttime usually goes unnoticed.
In Europe’s case, the European Union’s fiscal rules are at issue, and the Commission – in principle the EU’s watchdog – should bark loudly when they are flouted.
Last month, howls seemed inevitable after two large EU countries, Italy and France, submitted budget plans for 2015 that clearly violated their governments’ vows of continued austerity.
At first, the Commission dutifully rejected the two budgets as incompatible with the rules of the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).
But then something happened that was as “curious” as in Arthur Conan Doyle’s story.
Within days, both countries offered mini-adjustments to their budgets, worth about 0.2% of GDP, and their finance ministers wrote to the Commission that their budgets should now be approved.
The Commission did not react, leaving French and Italian leaders to claim that they, not Brussels bureaucrats, had the last word.
In fact, the latest forecast reflects an even worse outcome for France and Italy this year than originally promised, with France’s deficit set to increase slightly for 2015 and Italy’s cyclically adjusted deficit expected to deteriorate.
The Stability and Growth Pact prescribes an annual improvement of at least 0.5 % of GDP.
The new Commission thus risks losing its authority from the very start of its mandate.
Whether it does is a crucial question, because maintaining a high degree of credibility is essential to economic policymaking in the eurozone.
To see why, it is worth recalling that the SGP’s original rules were judged “stupid” by one former Commission president (Romano Prodi), because the single-minded pursuit of a deficit below 3 % of GDP could be inappropriate during recessions.
That argument was accepted, and the SGP was supposedly rendered more “intelligent” by, for example, permitting budget deficits to be adjusted for the economic cycle, adding medium-term objectives for expenditure, and introducing escape clauses.
But the new rules obviously require a strong institution to interpret them, and whose judgment is accepted by everybody.
Though checking whether a budget is below the SGP’s ceiling of 3% of GDP may be a straightforward matter, there can be reasonable disagreement about whether the business-cycle adjustment should be estimated at 0.5% or 0.8% of GDP, or whether a country is adhering to its medium-term expenditure objective.
The Commission is supposed to have the last word, thereby ensuring the rules’ credibility and consistency – and it seems to have lost this fight in the first round.
One could, of course, argue that the SGP should be scrapped, because austerity makes no sense when the eurozone faces the risk of deflation.
But the Commission, not fiscally louche member countries, should be the one to decide that.
The other problem for Europe is a dog that does bark, but for no reason.
This is the case of the United Kingdom, which has been asked to pay an additional contribution to the EU budget of about €2 billion ($2.5 billion, which amounts to a rounding error of the UK’s own budget).
The reason for this additional levy is that a few weeks ago the UK’s Office for National Statistics announced, proudly, that it had discovered that the country’s gross national income (GNI) had been much higher than previously assumed, not only in 2013, but also in all previous years.
Including the revisions for the 2002-2012 period, the difference comes to about £350 billion ($560 billion).
Because every EU member state is obliged to contribute about 1% of its GNI to the Union’s budget, the UK’s data revision had to lead to a back payment of billions of euros.
But British Prime Minister David Cameron’s government has declared that it does not intend to pay money that “the European Commission was not expecting and does not need.”
These two cases – the dog that should have barked but did not, and the dog that barked for no reason – threaten the EU’s fundamental workings, which are based on a clear rulebook enforced vigorously by a strong Commission.
Juncker’s Commission risks losing its authority from the start if the rules can be bent or broken to accommodate the larger member states’ domestic political priorities.
The Commission must regain political and intellectual leadership and make its choice: either explain why the SGP rules must be followed even now, in the face of deflation, or agree with those who argue that the current environment calls for a fiscal stimulus.
It cannot avoid taking sides by insisting publicly on austerity rules but then acquiescing when member states break them.
Leaders in member states have to play their part as well.
Pandering to populists may be attractive in terms of short-term electoral gains, but the long-term cost in terms of credibility, both their own and that of the EU, will be very high.
This year, however, senior government officials from Brazil, China, India, Nigeria, Singapore, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia also joined, an important sign of the times.
John McCain, the US senator and 2008 presidential candidate, always leads a large congressional delegation to Munich.
The US administration also typically sends the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of State to deliver a ritual speech reassuring the Europeans of the strength of the transatlantic alliance.
This year, Vice President Joe Biden did the honors, bumping the US representation up a notch.
The conference also featured a panel on an unusual subject – “The American Oil and Gas Bonanza: The Changing Geopolitics of Energy.”
US Special Envoy and Coordinator for International Energy Affairs Carlos Pascual described “the US internal energy revolution”: a 25% increase in natural-gas production, which should push down US gas prices, and enough oil output to reduce oil imports from 60% to 40% of consumption, with an additional 10% increase projected.
Pascual projected that the US will be able to import all of its energy needs from within the Americas by 2030.
A recent confidential study by the German Intelligence Agency raises the possibility that the US could actually become an oil and gas exporter by 2020, in contrast to its present position as the world’s largest energy importer.
That honor would likely fall to China, which would become increasingly dependent on the Middle East.
As an extra bonus, the higher US proportion of gas use has reduced US carbon emissions to 1992 levels.
The sense of US good fortune, a phrase that is not often heard around the world these days, increased with the panelists’ description of how lower energy prices for US manufacturing has a broad positive impact on the American economy’s competitiveness.
As a result, the country’s energy reserves have also become an investment magnet.
German Minister of Economics and Technology Philipp Rösler said that many German firms are already relocating to the US because of lower energy prices.
Equally important, the panelists reported on the rising importance of liquid natural gas relative to pipeline gas, which has enormous geopolitical implications.
In a nutshell, if gas is exported in liquid form, it is fungible.
In other words, if Russia restricts the flow of gas to Ukraine for political reasons, but the rest of Europe has gas from other sources, they can simply resell their gas to Ukraine and export it via the Baltic Sea.
Jorma Ollila, Chairman of Royal Dutch Shell, described the global map of major shale oil and gas deposits.
Ukraine itself has the third-largest reserves in Europe; other countries with large deposits include Poland, France, China, Indonesia, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, and Mexico.
And the US has already taken over from Russia as the world’s largest gas producer.
All of this data got Brazilian Foreign Minister Antonio de Aguiar Patriota’s attention.
On a panel entitled “The Rising Powers and Global Governance,” Patriota referred to the energy discussion and noted that the rising powers should remember that “the established powers are not sinking powers.”
In short, the pervasive narrative of Western decline suddenly reversed itself.
The horizon seemed brighter on the European side as well.
In the opening panel on “The Euro Crisis and the Future of the EU,” cautious optimism prevailed.
No one thought that the European Union’s troubles were resolved, but no one thought that the eurozone was coming apart, either.
On the contrary, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble made clear that German resolve to see the eurozone through its troubles was firm.
And a prominent economist in the audience who has often predicted the eurozone’s demise was backtracking rapidly.
Aside from reports of a rising US (fiscal woes notwithstanding) and a stabilizing Europe (despite the common currency’s troubles), the conference featured a speech by Biden that went far beyond the reassuring rhetoric that US policymakers typically offer in European capitals.
Biden told the audience that he and US President Barack Obama believe that “Europe is the cornerstone of our engagement with the rest of the world” and “the catalyst for our global cooperation.”
Biden pointed out that “Europe is America’s largest economic partner,” recalling figures that the Asia-focused Obama administration has often seemed to forget: “over $600 billion in annual trade that creates and sustains millions of jobs on the continent and at home, and a $5 trillion overall commercial relationship.”
Biden went on to suggest a “comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment agreement”; a week later, in his State of the Union Address, Obama announced the launch of negotiations for precisely such an agreement.
Biden concluded with a flourish.
“Europe remains America’s indispensable partner of first resort,” he declared. “And, if you forgive some presumptuousness, I believe we remain your indispensable partner.”
Those strong words reflect a new sensibility in Washington.
As former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared in one of her last foreign-policy speeches, the US is not planning to pivot away from Europe to Asia, but rather with Europe to Asia.
Western fortunes are rising, slowly but surely.
Together, Europe and the US account for more than 50% of global GDP, have the largest military force in the world by many multiples, and control a growing proportion of global energy reserves.
They also have a formidable diplomatic and development-assistance capacity, representing a peaceful community of democracies that share a common commitment to the rights, dignity, and potential of all human beings.
Imagine that community spreading down the east coast of Latin America and the west coast of Africa.
It might be an Atlantic century after all.
Europe and Asia’s Arms Race
When European unification was launched, it was thought that “ever closer union” would establish a community that would protect Europeans from political blackmail.
Now we see – though the lifting of the Union’s arms embargo may now be delayed thanks to US pressure and Chinese aggressiveness – that the European Union has become merely a tool for corruption when France and China draw up joint action plans.
The strategy is simple and ruthless.
The world’s largest dictatorship is preparing to crush and occupy the first Chinese democracy in history – Taiwan.
In order to do so, the People’s Republic needs much more sophisticated arms than those it possesses today.
The United States naturally does not export such arms to China.
Instead, the US is trying to deter China’s rulers from launching a military attack on the democrats in Taiwan.
But if the EU ever begins to offer China extensive exports of powerful and offensive weapons systems, the military power of the People’s Liberation Army would be able to defeat Taiwan’s defense forces.
Over 600 missiles, already deployed on the mainland, are aimed at cities and military bases on the island.
The threat is more apparent than real – for now.
Russia currently sells certain arms to China, but avoids exporting its most sophisticated systems, since the Kremlin views China as a potential future threat.
However, if EU countries start competing for a share of the Chinese market, the Russians could soon be tempted to sell their best arms to the communist regime in Beijing.
China’s new armaments, together with the North Korean crisis, will probably force half a dozen countries in the region to renew their armed forces.
Thus, by whenever the Union should decide to lift its ban on weapons exports to China, the EU could help fuel an arms race in East Asia.
How did China and France manage to fool the EU into thinking that it should ever take part in this?
When Jacques Chirac’s government decided to expound its economic co-operation with China, arms became an important component in the strategy.
Just as a ruthless Prime Minister Chirac sold a nuclear reactor to Saddam Hussein in the 1970’s, so the President Chirac of today is being lured into doing big business with another aggressive dictatorship.
The rest is a question of economic blackmail.
French diplomats have of course informed China about the reluctance of other European countries about lifting the arms embargo, which was imposed after the massacre in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
China then simply threatened to abandon or never to conclude trade deals with these EU members.
To the Germans, the Chinese probably murmur something about Siemens and Volkswagen.
To the Dutch their whispers are most likely about Philips.
China follows the power game within the EU through its French friends, and therefore knows which governments need to be whipped into line.
In Sweden, it has probably been enough to whisper “Ericsson” and “Volvo” to make Primer Minister Göran Persson understand what is at stake for his country commercially.
What European nation, indeed, dares to put at risk a Chinese order for several billion euros?
Typically enough, no EU-country has mentioned Taiwan as a reason not to resume arms exports.
Instead, the EU talks of a “code of conduct” (which probably does not mean very much, but sounds nice) and “free trade” (another charming euphemism for arms exports to dictatorships.
This silence gives a hideous signal.
For what the EU in practice says to China is this: “Taiwan’s cause in not our own.”
If and when the Union lifts the embargo, Europe will be refusing to take responsibility for the catastrophe that may be approaching.
As usual, it is up to America to protect a free nation that may otherwise be destroyed.
Compare this situation to the drama 60 years ago.
Then it was American troops and arms that liberated Western Europe from Nazism.
Now it may be European arms in the hands of the Chinese that will be aimed at American troops protecting a democracy with 23 million inhabitants (in other words, as many people as in all the Nordic countries combined).
As Tom Lantos, a Democratic US Congressman from California, put it, the move to lift the ban on arms exports to China clearly shows that the EU has “lost its moral compass.”
Lantos knows about moral compasses: as a boy, he was rescued by Raoul Wallenberg from being deported to Auschwitz by the Nazis in Budapest.
Wallenberg was a Swede.
But now Sweden is revealing that it, too, lacks political morality.
Several friends of mine in the Conservative party’s parliamentary group have long been engaged in supporting a free Taiwan.
Over the past ten years, we have held Scandinavian conferences on Taiwan in the parliaments in Copenhagen, Oslo, and Stockholm.
But a call from Prime Minister Persson was enough to render the Conservative party leader Fredrik Reinfeldt docile.
Persson had discovered that he lacked a majority in the Swedish parliament to lift the arms embargo on China.
By whispering “Ericsson” into Reinfeldt’s ear, it seems, Persson achieved the desired result.
Reinfeldt became the first Conservative party leader in Swedish history to encourage arms exports to a Communist dictatorship.
But Reinfeldt, like Jacques Chirac, has forgotten something.
Liberal-minded people may very well prefer not just to exchange one cynical prime minister for another at the next election.
They may prefer a clear choice.
European Defense Integration Now
MADRID – During the European Union’s recent Bratislava summit, the first to take place without a British presence, several proposals to improve European security were made.
Though some may argue otherwise, discussions on improved European security are both wise and necessary: after a period of paralysis and self-doubt for the European project, the EU must face its security problems and propose unifying initiatives.
Europe’s citizens increasingly regard security as a high-priority issue and want the EU to show greater leadership.
The EU’s friends and allies expect improvement in European security as well.
Offering EU citizens security within the Union’s borders requires more stability abroad.
Recent events have shown this clearly: the refugee crisis bedeviling the EU, for example, would be much easier to manage if the situation in Syria was different.
Because security at home and abroad are so interrelated, the EU should not compartmentalize its policies – an idea that is well developed in the proposed new “Global Strategy” for the Union, presented recently by High Representative Federica Mogherini.
Traditionally, nation-states have defended themselves against foreign threats through military means, while running their internal affairs according to a set of norms designed to protect their citizens’ rights.
Today, military preparedness is still necessary to defend against external threats, but it is no longer sufficient.
A “civilian” angle is needed as well.
All assets needed to achieve security must adapt to the reality of today’s threats and conflicts.
This means that the EU’s military capacities cannot be structured in isolation, but must work side by side with its civil capabilities (police agencies, intelligence units, the courts, and even non-governmental organizations).
The capacity for a fused civil-military response to crisis must become integral to EU policy and that of its member states.
The EU has already undertaken deployments that combine military and civilian capabilities.
But it has always been clear that much more is needed to improve the efficacy of such actions.
Indeed, the EU’s Treaty of Lisbon includes many measures along these lines, but most have not yet been implemented.
One reason for this is the distraction caused by the EU’s economic problems since 2008.
But now the gravity of the refugee problem requires that humanitarian and security issues be framed within a pan-European outlook.
The division between the domestic and external capacities of EU member states simply is no longer sustainable.
Fortunately, many of the capacities available to member states in their internal policies are also useful for their defense deployments.
For example, it is increasingly clear that enhancing intelligence cooperation is essential.
If the EU wants to extend the reach of its security policies, it will need more resources; but, above all, existing capacities need to be used better and more cooperatively.
But such cooperation requires a strategic headquarters for all EU security-related operations, rather than maintaining the current model whereby operational centers are established on an ad hoc basis.
Moreover, in order for the EU to achieve strategic autonomy, it needs a competitive European defense industry, with investment in research and development of defense technologies rising substantially as part of a common effort.
The European Defense Agency’s Capabilities Development Plan was designed precisely with these requirements in mind.
Advancing this plan will enable optimized use of existing member-state resources – thereby securing advantageous economic synergies – as well as precise identification of the additional resources required to achieve our goals.
The legal basis for a mechanism for permanent, structured cooperation on security already exists, enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon.
Treaty provisions enable willing EU states to reinforce their military cooperation and deploy quickly for shared missions abroad.
Activating this mechanism has been part of recent discussions within the European Council and seems to be the most viable way to deepen defense integration.
And an EU with security and defense as one of its pillars would boost Europe’s global weight.
Some still think that deeper defense integration may weaken other institutions, such as NATO, to which EU members belong.
But the truth is that Europe’s ability to provide an effective collective response in a crisis would be welcomed by NATO (which would have more resources at its disposal) and the United Nations.
Integrating EU defense, moreover, would facilitate NATO operations, so that groups of EU countries engaged in permanent structured cooperation could, for example, participate in the North Atlantic Council, NATO’s governing authority, as a single entity.
The EU is defined not only by how it protects its own citizens, but also by what actions it takes outside its borders.
Beyond ensuring that these actions are guided by international law, the EU should foster a global debate on the deficiencies of certain international norms in the face of today’s new conflicts.
Even in this era of pervasive Euroskepticism, Europe’s citizens want a more decisive EU approach to foreign and security policy, which is necessary, beneficial, and part of our duty.
The EU, after all, will be defined by its actions, and peace and security are among the public goods that it must provide, both within and beyond its borders.
European Discrimination on Trial
What good are Europe’s treaties aimed at ensuring the legal equality of all citizens when entire groups face systematic discrimination?
That is the question that the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) faces this week as its Grand Chamber, consisting of 17 judges, begins considering an appeal of an initial ruling that rejected claims of discrimination against the Roma by the Czech Republic’s education authorities.
All European states are members of the Council of Europe, all have signed the European Convention on Human Rights, 39 of the 46 member states have adopted the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, and 14 have ratified Protocol 12 on the prohibition against discrimination.
Nevertheless, the living conditions of many Roma remain appalling.
Although recent reports published in 2006 by the European Union’s Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia and the Council of Europe’s Human Rights Commissioner note some improvements, they indicate Roma living conditions have stagnated, if not deteriorated.
Roma are still victims of discrimination in access to housing, employment, healthcare, and education, despite significant local efforts at the Council of Europe’s instigation and with its support.
Discrimination in educational access is particularly important, given its profound effect on its victims’ life prospects.
In the most extreme cases, the education system itself is segregated: isolated schools in remote camps; special classes for Roma children in mainstream schools; and an over-representation of Roma children in classes for children with learning difficulties.
The EHCR was confronted with the third issue in the case D.H. and others vs. Czech Republic .
The Court was referred to 18 cases of girls and boys who, between 1996 and 1999, were placed in special schools for children with learning difficulties, either directly or after a period of time in primary schools.
The question was whether the children were victims of discrimination owing to their national minority status.
The Czech government admitted that some of the special schools’ student bodies comprised 80% to 90% Roma children.
However, if there was discrimination, it was not direct, because under Czech law, such a move could be decided only by a school headmaster based on the results of an intelligence test at an educational psychology counseling centre, and subject to the approval of the child’s parents or legal guardian.
A difference in treatment is not discriminatory in itself.
According to the case law of national supreme courts and the ECHR, discrimination exists only when people in a similar situation are treated differently.
Yet national and international case law recognizes that a non-discriminatory measure in theory can be discriminatory in practice.
So, in the current case, the alleged discrimination does not stem from the law itself, but from its effects, with the plaintiffs relying mainly on statistics showing the over-representation of Roma in special schools.
Many other reports on the situation of Roma in the Czech Republic, including by the Council of Europe, are available.
But, as the Court rightly noted, it should rule only on the cases to which it is referred, and should not make known its opinion on the Czech education system’s legitimacy, as choices concerning educational opportunities fall under the jurisdiction of states and therefore can vary accordingly.
Working on this assumption and given the case it had to solve, an EHCR panel of seven judges ruled against the plaintiffs in February 2006, concluding that the law on special schools is not aimed specifically at Roma and does not apply only to them.
According to the Court, the law’s legitimate purpose is to adapt teaching to the difficulties of a specific category of pupils, and psychological tests seem to be objective enough not to be suspected of racial bias.
Moreover, the requirement of parents’ approval for placing children in special schools remains valid, while Roma children who were initially placed in those schools could have returned to mainstream schools later, and thus reintegrated into normal schooling.
As well-founded as the Court’s reasoning may be, a feeling of unease persists.
The statistics showing the enormous proportion of Roma children in those schools are hard to ignore, and the suspicion of discrimination is difficult to avoid.
While laws have changed, mentalities do not always follow at the same pace, and we intuitively know that it is easy to get psychology to mean a lot of things.
Indeed, before announcing its decision, the Court felt it necessary to state that while it did not conclude that the Convention had been violated, statistics still revealed “worrying figures, and the situation in general in the Czech Republic regarding Roma children’s education needs to be improved.”
The Court’s president, Jean-Paul Costa, expressed a similar view, without questioning the legitimacy of the decision, although Judge Cabral Barreto wrote a dissenting opinion.
Moreover, it is significant that the Court agreed, at the request of the parties, to refer the case on appeal to its Grand Chamber.
According to Costa, rejecting the ruling in February 2006 would contradict previous case law.
Will the Court, then, decide on the workings of the Czech education system itself?
Or will it follow Judge Barreto, who calls for recognition of an obligation to adopt affirmative action policies aimed at benefiting Romanies?
Whatever formula is adopted, it is certain that Roma children should be afforded the same opportunities as other children.
It is this imperative that underlies the importance of the coming decision, for it provides an occasion for the Court to reassert the fundamental principle of non-discrimination that defines our democratic societies.
The Birth of Fiscal Unions
PRINCETON – Fiscal unification is often an effective way to enhance creditworthiness, and it may also create a new sense of solidarity among diverse peoples living within a large geographic area.
For this reason, Europeans have often looked toward the model of the United States.
But they have never been able to emulate it, because their motivations for union have been so varied.
Desperate countries often consider such unions to be the best way out of an emergency.
In 1940, Charles de Gaulle proposed, and Winston Churchill accepted, the idea of a Franco-British union in the face of the Nazi challenge, which had already overwhelmed France.
In 1950, five years after the war, Germany’s first postwar chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, also proposed a union – this time between France and Germany – as a way out of his defeated country’s existential crisis.
Political unification was rejected; but economic association has had a brilliant career for more than six decades – until now.
The fundamental idea behind a fiscal union is that poorer, less creditworthy countries can gain from joint debt liability with richer countries.
Indeed, one of the most fascinating proposals to this effect came at the beginning of World War I, when the Russian Empire found that its limited capacity to borrow on international capital markets and its low foreign-currency reserves left it unable to create an effective military force.
So the Russian government proposed what would have amounted to a full fiscal union with Britain and France for war-related finances.
France latched onto the idea, because its borrowing capacity was also weaker than Britain’s.
The British wanted to win the war – but not so much that they were prepared to accept unlimited liability for debt incurred by the French and Russian governments.
In reality, a fiscal union between such diverse political systems would have been unworkable.
An autocratic or corrupt regime has a strong incentive to spend in a way that benefits the elite.
That incentive increases if it can command the resources of a more democratically governed state, where citizens agree to pay taxes (and pay off future debt) because they also control the government.
The only circumstance in which democracies sign up to such a deal is when a clear security interest is at stake.
It was that predicament that gave pre-1914 Russia unique access to the French financial market.
Yet, in 1915, the British, even in the face of an ongoing war, were unwilling to assume Russia’s liabilities.
Perhaps the sheer degree of uncertainty in pre-war Europe, or the more amorphous nature of the threat, made security concerns trump financial risk.
Russia’s World War I credit arrangements anticipated some of the political maneuvering about debt and its relation to security that occurred in late-twentieth-century Europe.
Post-1945 West Germany was vulnerable for a long time, because it sat on the Cold War’s fault line.
As a result, West German governments offered neighboring countries financial help in exchange for security and political solidarity, especially at moments when they were uncertain about the reliability and continuity of US support.
But there were limits.
In 1979, when West Germany adopted a fixed exchange-rate regime with a support mechanism for its partners (the European Monetary System), the Bundesbank ensured that it was not committed to unlimited currency interventions and that it might stop when the stability of the Deutsche Mark was endangered.
The logic was repeated on an even larger scale at the beginning of the 1990’s, but this time without any pre-determined limits.
The European Union’s commitment to monetary union enabled the eurozone’s Mediterranean countries to improve their debt dynamics and public finances dramatically.
Their borrowing costs fell as they locked their currencies into a union with countries – Germany, in particular – with a stronger reputation for stability.
At that point, the problem of how to divide the eventual bill when things became costly was not addressed, and the problem of excessive debt was wished away by the establishment of convergence criteria (which were not fully implemented anyway).
But, since 2009, when financial distress in the eurozone’s periphery brought such problems to the fore, Europeans have faced the same question as the WWI Allies.
Are security and political interests so overwhelming that they justify assuming large and unlimited liabilities incurred by political systems over which they have no control?
Because Europe is at peace, with no singular, overriding security threat, it is likely that when the extent of the bargain becomes clear, voters and politicians in the rich creditor countries will reject it.
But the more uncertain security challenges that Europe faces may just demand the kind of strong fiscal link that the French and Russians were willing to forge before 1914, and that the Germans and French embraced in 1950.
The implications for the present are important: the only palatable way in which the necessary balance between liability and security can be achieved is through a process of political reform that dissolves corrupt oligarchies and weakens incentives for fiscal imprudence.
One approach might be to ask citizens in all European countries whether they are prepared to accept some sort of fiscal compact involving a hard limit on debt.
Germans refer to this solution as a Schuldenbremse (debt brake).
It presupposes a profound process through which institutions and the assumptions underlying them come to be widely shared.
But that takes time, as the history of the US – the world’s most successful union born of emergency – amply demonstrates.
Europe and the Global Food Crisis
PARIS – The world has been shaken by unprecedented spikes in food prices, by hunger riots, and by social tensions that demonstrate that food supplies have returned as a source of insecurity – to which global warming and declining natural resources are adding unprecedented urgency.
By 2050, it is estimated that there will be nine billion people on earth, so the need for food may double – primarily among urban populations in the world’s poorest countries.
But there is more to finding a solution than simply identifying those nations that are capable of feeding the rest of the world.
It is increasingly urgent that every nation gain the means of feeding itself.
This means that agriculture should become an international priority, with the poorest countries helped to safeguard the security and independence of their food supplies.
Countries and organizations are already mobilizing.
The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization argues that rising food prices could lead to increasing global conflicts.
The Davos World Economic Forum ranks food insecurity as a major risk to humanity.
The World Bank has forcefully emphasized the importance of agriculture to jump-starting economic expansion and breaking the cycle of poverty.
UN Secretary Ban Ki-moon has created a working group to define a common plan of action, and France’s President Nicolas Sarkozy has proposed a global partnership for food.
Sarkozy’s proposed partnership has three pillars.
First, an international group should draft a worldwide strategy for food security.
Second, an international scientific platform should be charged with evaluating the world’s agricultural situation, sending out warnings of upcoming crises, and possibly facilitating governments’ adoption of political and other strategic tools to deal with food crises.
Finally, the international finance community, despite its current problems, must be mobilized.
The reliability and size of the European Union’s farm output means that it can and should play the role of regulator in global markets.
If Europe cut back on its agricultural production, the increase in its own food imports would contribute significantly to a worldwide increase in food prices.
This makes it imperative that EU food production levels be held steady – for the sake of Europeans and of people in the world’s poorest countries.
But Europe cannot build up its own agriculture to the detriment of the less fortunate.
So the EU must harmonize its policies with poorer countries.
At present, export subsidies and support payments represent less than 1% of the European agricultural budget, and the EU has undertaken to eliminate them once it receives reciprocal undertakings from major food-exporting countries.
Since 2001, with the “Everything but Arms” initiative, all products from poor countries – with the exception of weapons and munitions – can enter the EU single market on a duty-free basis.
This has led to the EU becoming the primary market for the poorest countries’ products.
The EU is also developing ways to respond to new global challenges through changes to its Common Agricultural Policy.
This was reflected in the decision to suspend the “set aside” rule that requires a proportion of agricultural land to lie fallow.
Now the EU is preparing to increase dairy quotas progressively, and evaluating the impact on world markets of its decisions regarding bio-fuels.
But Europe’s focus must be on encouraging the development of local agriculture.
Doing so is the only way to achieve greater global food security and reduce poverty.
It will also make it possible to ensure that today’s high prices for agricultural products are transformed into opportunity for poor farmers.
This is vital because, according to the World Bank, growth in farming eliminates poverty twice as much as growth in any other economic sector.
Indeed, agriculture remains the primary productive sector in the world’s poorest countries, employing 65% of the working population and, on average, contributing more than 25% to GDP.
But over the past 20 years, support for agricultural development has been declining.
Only 4% of public development assistance is now earmarked for agriculture.
The European Commission and EU member states are therefore planning to increase their assistance, both through the European Development Fund and by developing new sources of financial support.
Further liberalization of farm trade will not ensure food security.
Faced with the erratic nature of agricultural markets, regulation is needed to soften the impact on poorer countries of volatile food prices.
This does not mean that protectionism is the way forward, only that taking account of specific issues that affect international farm trade – weather, price volatility, or health risks – may be necessary from time to time.
But, in a world where productivity differentials can be as great as one to 1,000, it would be unwise to rely on markets alone to enable the poorest countries to expand their economies.
Nor is it likely that much economic expansion will result from competition between multinational food distributors and producers in countries where famine still stalks the land.
Instead, bringing together outside expertise and local knowledge of the geography and environmental and economic constraints in order to spread risks and share the management of resources and projects is far more likely to help poor countries achieve food independence.
It was such an approach that, in less than 20 years, helped postwar Europe achieve food sovereignty.
Countries that have protected their agricultural development from the threats posed by international markets – such as India or Vietnam – have achieved substantial reductions in agricultural poverty.
The time has also come to prioritize agriculture in order to ensure growth with a more human face.
At the heart of the EU, France wants to play its part in a collective effort that is fast becoming a major issue for us all.
Crisis and Transformation
ANKARA – It has become a cliché to characterize our era as one of multiple rapid transformations.
But 2012 was particularly eventful. Not a single day passed without requiring continuous and concerted attention to economic crises, political and military conflicts, social upheavals, cultural clashes, or environmental problems in some corner of the world.
Turkey’s immediate neighborhood occupied the top spot on the global policy agenda in 2012, and will continue to so in 2013.
To our north, Europe is at a crossroads, undergoing a process of creative destruction, with potentially far-reaching ramifications well beyond the confines of the European Union.
To our south, an irreversible quest for dignity, freedom, democracy, and peace is altering the region’s political landscape.
Needless to say, economic measures alone cannot end the EU’s ongoing crisis.
Europe must redefine itself and identify its mission anew if it wishes to retain its geopolitical weight.
The EU must decide whether it represents a community of values or a narrowly defined geographic entity whose exclusionary impulses will eventually erode its global relevance.
As an integral part of Europe with EU membership as a strategic objective, Turkey is not an indifferent bystander; on the contrary, we strive to participate in the current debate by offering our own views and ideas.
We believe, for example, that EU integration needs to be wider as well as deeper, thereby maintaining its positive transformative influence in neighboring regions.
Here, of course, the Middle East and North Africa should be of paramount concern.
Historically, whatever happens on one side of the Mediterranean has had a direct impact on the other; given today’s high level of global interdependence, there is every reason to believe that this will remain true.
The Arab peoples’ genuine aspiration to secure for themselves the universal rights that Europeans enjoy refutes the West’s long-held orientalist perspective.
Of course, it is still too early to predict the outcome of the Arab Awakening, and the countries in transition still face daunting challenges.
But none of the various nightmare scenarios materialized, which augurs hope for the future.
Moreover, in Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt, free and fair elections –&#160;the first in these countries’ history – were held in 2012.
But democracy is not only about elections. The task of creating essential democratic institutions – the rule of law, habits of accountability, gender equality, and freedom of expression and faith – still awaits these countries.
Yet the Arab peoples have finally experienced genuine empowerment, and have crossed the threshold of fear.
I believe that they will continue to advance toward democracy.
That said, the situation in Syria and recent Israeli aggression in Gaza remain open wounds.
In Syria, a bloody civil war is laying waste to some of the world’s most magnificent ancient cities.
The Syrian people’s demands are the same as those heard in Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt: a dignified, democratic life.
Instead, they have gotten an inhuman campaign of violence – including attacks by warplanes, helicopters, and tanks – by President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.
The regime’s effort to turn its struggle for survival into an ethnic and sectarian conflict could wreak havoc across the region, starting with neighbors like Lebanon and Iraq.
From the very outset of the Arab Awakening, Turkey has taken a principled stand on the side of legitimate and democratic aspirations.
Aware of our special role as a historical partner and, more so, as a source of inspiration to those demanding their rights and freedom, we felt particularly compelled to do so.
For Turkey, the civil war in Syria has created an additional challenge in the form of a humanitarian crisis.
We are now hosting approximately 200,000 Syrians who fled their country’s growing violence, and have already spent more than $400 million to accommodate these desperate people – with almost no assistance from the rest of the world.
But we will never be dissuaded from helping our Syrian neighbors in their most difficult hour, given the special bonds emanating from centuries of shared history.
Two other fundamental and inter-related security challenges in the region – the Arab-Israeli conflict and the growing danger of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) – also must be resolved in order to ensure that the Middle East’s historic transformation leads to security, stability, and prosperity.
Here, the recent violence in Gaza has once again demonstrated the risk of an all-out regional conflict.
Israel’s latest operation in Gaza brought it no benefit, either tactical or strategic.
On the contrary, this aggression, clearly staged for domestic political consumption, will harm Israel’s long-term security.
For the first time, Hamas proved capable of causing disruptions as far away as Tel Aviv, while Israel was forced to defend its behavior and reputation even with its traditional allies, including the United States.
But the biggest lesson for Israel is that it needs to comprehend better the new strategic environment following the Arab Awakening.
It is imperative to adopt a more holistic approach to both of these problems.
The reference point for such an effort should be parallel implementation of the 2002 Arab Peace Plan, which addresses Israel’s security concerns, and a regional disarmament mechanism based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 687, adopted in 1991 to enable the elimination of WMDs from the entire region.
I deeply appreciate US President Barack Obama’s remarks at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in 2010, at which he supported this idea and invited other major actors to take the initiative on disarmament.
This approach would enable a fair and lasting resolution of the Palestinian issue, which profoundly offends people’s sense of justice and causes instability and extremism, while eliminating tensions arising from the threat perceptions of Iran and other countries in the region.
Beyond this, advanced countries and international financial institutions should implement a comprehensive economic recovery program for the Arab countries in transition, similar to the Marshall Plan implemented after World War II.
Europe and the international community have an opportunity to help the Mediterranean region to regain the prosperity and grandeur that it once had, and to turn the Middle East into a zone of peace, democracy, and stability.
Turkey will play whatever part it can in order to realize this vision.
Europe and the New World Order
BERLIN – November 15, 2008, is a date to remember, because on that day history was made.
For the first time, the G-20, the world’s 20 leading economies, came together in Washington, D.C., to find an answer to the global financial and economic crisis.
While this first meeting resulted in nothing more than declarations of intent, it still marks a historic turning point.
Faced with the gravest financial and economic crisis worldwide since the 1930’s, the Western industrial nations (including Russia) that previously dominated the world economy are no longer capable of coming up with an effective response.
Moreover, hopes for mitigating or, indeed, overcoming the global economic crisis rest exclusively with the emerging economic powers, first and foremost China.
As a result, the G-8, which excludes the most important emerging-market countries, has lost its significance for good.
Globalization has resulted in a lasting change in the distribution of power and opportunities, laying the groundwork for a new world order for the twenty-first century.
Once the current global crisis is over, nothing will ever be the same again.
The West – the United States and Europe – are in relative decline, while the emerging Asian and Latin American powers will be among the winners.
The US has responded to the decline of its global strength in an impressive manner, with the election of its first African-American president, Barack Obama.
Amidst one of the gravest crises in its history, America has proven to itself and the world its ability to reinvent itself.
And it is clear even now that this decision will have three long-term consequences.
First, the election of a black president will put to rest the tragic legacy of slavery and the American Civil War.
From now on, the issues of skin color, eye shape, or gender will no longer play a deciding role for a candidate for high, or even the highest, office.
The US political system now reflects the country’s demographic changes, as non-white sections of the population grow the fastest.
Second, Obama’s election will lead to a reorientation of US foreign policy in the medium term.
In particular, the transatlantic/European focus of American foreign policy, which was previously a matter of course, will increasingly become a thing of the past.
Third, the internal realignment of America’s political-cultural perspective will be reinforced by the ongoing global shift of wealth and power from the West to the East.
The Northeastern Pacific powers – China, Japan, and South Korea – are already America’s most significant creditors by far, and their importance will increase further as a result of the financial crisis.
For the foreseeable future, the greatest opportunities for growth lie in this region, and for both economic and geopolitical reasons America will increasingly turn toward the Pacific region, thus downgrading its transatlantic orientation.
All of this is bad news for Europe, because once this global crisis is over, Europeans will simply have become less important.
And, unfortunately, Europe is not only doing nothing to hold off or reverse its decline – it is accelerating the process through its own behavior.
With the election of Obama, America has turned toward the future within a globalized, multipolar world; Europe, on the other hand, is rediscovering national action in this time of crisis, and thus banking on the past!
The European constitution has failed, the Lisbon reform treaty is in limbo after the Irish rejected it, and stronger European economic governance is blocked by German-French disunity.
The reaction of EU member states to this ongoing self-inflicted impasse is unambiguous: rather than trying to reenergize the process of further political and economic integration, they are primarily acting on their own to try to fill the vacuum that has emerged.
Certainly, coordination between the member states exists, and is even successful at times, but without strong European institutions, such singular successes will not last.
There is a very real danger that Europe will simply miss out on an historic strategic turn towards a multipolar world – and at a high price.
After the summit in Washington, it should have sunk in among Europeans everywhere – even the Euroskeptics of the British Isles – that this strategic realignment is taking place right now!
If Europeans cannot get their heads around the fact that the nineteenth century is over, the global caravan will continue to move forward into the twenty-first century without them.
The Power of a European Energy Union
DUBLIN – One of the top priorities established by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker ahead of his election last summer was the creation of a European energy union.
He was right to do so.
Done properly, a more cohesive energy policy could achieve three strategic objectives simultaneously.
By coordinating research and investment, encouraging conservation, and integrating energy markets, an energy union would help fight climate change, provide Europe with a much needed economic stimulus, and protect the continent from supply shocks, such as those caused by the crises in North Africa and Ukraine.
Of course, the European Union's ability to act is dependent on the willingness of its member states; and, though some of the continent's leaders have championed the initiative, others have proved less enthusiastic.
A crucial test of their collective resolve will be whether they are willing to support key infrastructure projects that deliver on all three objectives.
One good example of such a project is the North Sea Countries' Offshore Grid Initiative, a proposal that would link offshore wind farms to a new regional grid, and allow countries to balance variable power supplies across borders.
The idea – first advanced in a 2009 memorandum of understanding signed by nine EU member states and Norway – has enormous potential; by 2030, North Sea winds could provide Europe with 10% of its electricity – carbon-free.
But if the project is to go forward, it urgently needs a political mandate.
The integrated grid can be imagined as a large ring, connecting Norway with the United Kingdom, and then linking across the channel to France, Belgium, and Holland, before moving on to Germany and returning to Scandinavia.
Its implementation would allow Europe to introduce a free-trade zone for renewable energy, reducing the need for storage and excess capacity to back up variable power supplies.
Not only would the grid pay for itself; once in place, it would reduce the cost of new wind farms by some 30%, by providing them with an existing connection to energy markets.
An interconnected energy system would make particular sense for the UK and Germany, which could use the one-hour time difference between them to smooth out the peaks and troughs in demand.
Renewable energy production is by nature intermittent, and the sheer number of fluctuating power sources in Germany is already pushing its existing grid to the limit.
Interconnection would also reduce the number of new onshore transmission lines the country needs.
The German government has produced a policy paper outlining how a more integrated regional market might work.
Last year, the UK matched Germany's investments in clean energy, spending some $15.2 billion on solar panels and wind farms.
But Britain will need to do a lot more if it is to meet its climate targets.
According to a parliamentary report, “the cost of developing such a supergrid could be very high...but it may bring a host of economic benefits – including tens of thousands of new jobs in the offshore renewable industry."
A regional initiative would also allow Prime Minister David Cameron to accommodate opposition within his party to onshore renewable energy plants.
Each of the individual countries involved in the project would benefit from its construction.
Holland and Belgium need a cost-effective way to develop their own offshore resources.
Denmark already benefits from an interconnected electricity market; and the lesson it has learned is that it makes sense to integrate even further.
Norway would be able to sell its hydropower and secure a backup supply should climate change leave it running dry.
Advances in cable technology would allow Ireland to link to France, providing an alternative route to European markets if the UK elects to remain outside the network.
Juncker's €315 billion ($360 billion) investment plan, proposed in December, includes some €87 billion in interconnection projects.
It would make sense to combine these into a single initiative, with common standards for technology, planning, and regulations.
Doing so would lower the cost of capital on loans from the European Investment Bank and give a boost to European technology companies.
The Baltic states are also planning their own offshore grid.
But it is not just Northern Europe that could gain from such an approach.
Europe's southeastern and Mediterranean countries could also benefit from sharing power.
Most of the necessary legal and regulatory framework is already in place. There is no need for treaty changes or complex new legislation.
All that is needed is political direction, so that the European Commission can establish the necessary governance structures.
The strength of Europe's commitment to a true energy union will be revealed when the European Council meets on March 19.
Among the decisions it will make will be whether to build these regional grids.
If the EU and its member states reach an agreement, they could simultaneously boost their economies and improve their energy security.
If not, they could end up buying the technology from China or the United States, which will be investing in their own grids in the coming years.
Europe’s Energy Essentials
MADRID – At last month’s European Council meeting in Brussels, energy issues dominated the agenda – for the third time this year.
Energy’s emergence as a focal point for European leaders makes sense, given that it lies at the confluence of the three existential threats facing the European Union: a revisionist Russia, the declining competitiveness of European businesses, and climate change.
As these developments challenge Europe’s values, its social model’s viability, and the world’s long-term security,&nbsp;EU leaders must focus on building a new energy system that ensures a reliable supply, sensible pricing, and ecological sustainability.
The good news is that a framework is already emerging that could facilitate this initiative.
Indeed, beyond widely discussed targets for energy production for 2030 – covering greenhouse-gas emissions, energy efficiency, and renewable resources – the European Council’s conclusions embrace key elements of a practical and effective approach to energy.
But, in order to move from aspiration to implementation, Europeans must muster the unity of purpose that so far has been conspicuously absent in EU energy policy.
The most tangible element of the EU’s emerging energy-policy framework is the internal energy market, which, once completed, will allow for the unimpeded flow of energy and related investments throughout the EU.
Such an integrated energy market would lead to significant savings – estimates go as high as €40 billion ($51 billion) annually by 2030 – thereby providing a much-needed competitiveness boost.
The internal energy market would enhance Europe’s energy security as well.
Though the EU as a whole maintains a balanced energy mix, with supply divided relatively evenly among gas, coal, oil, renewables, and nuclear generation, individual countries are often excessively dependent on a single source and, more dangerously, a single supplier: Russia.
Unrestricted energy flows within the EU would mitigate the risks of supply disruptions or shocks.
Of course, establishing an internal energy market is not just a matter of policy.
The EU needs the right infrastructure to facilitate the movement of energy among states and regions.
On this front, there is much to be done.
Spain, for example, can currently transmit only 1.5% of its electricity-generating capacity to the rest of Europe, owing to a lack of transmission infrastructure in the Pyrenees and France’s reluctance to open its energy market to competition from the Iberian Peninsula.
The European Council, recognizing the urgency of this issue, has called for greater electricity interconnection, targeting 10% of generating capacity by 2020 and 15% by 2030, with countries exporting 15 megawatts of power for every 100 megawatts they produce.
Achieving these benchmarks will require both significant capital investment and a shift in EU member states’ mentalities, so that fears like France’s do not continue to impede progress.
Countries need to know that their companies will not suffer either from outflows of electricity to other EU countries during shortages, or from price increases, owing to the rising emphasis on renewables.
The emerging European “energy union,” which the Council has endorsed, could be the ideal vehicle to facilitate this shift.
The problem is that EU leaders have yet to define a compelling and effective strategy for building it.
Indeed, though European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has established a vice-presidential post responsible for energy union – now held by Maroš Šefčovič – no one seems to know what exactly the position will entail.
So far, Šefčovič has merely presented five vague pillars for the energy union, leading many to consider the current policy approach to an energy union hollow.
The EU needs a well-defined energy strategy that helps to overcome the trust deficit that is hampering effective solutions.
This means, first and foremost, establishing clear and predictable community rules and cost-sensitive policies for the energy union.
Doing so would help the EU to achieve another critical goal: presenting a more united front to the rest of the world.
The Council’s recent conclusions recognize this imperative, and the new Commission structure is conducive to policy coherence.
Member states must now fall into line.
A major test will be next year’s United Nations climate change conference (COP21) in Paris.
The 2009 conference in Copenhagen was an unmitigated disaster, as Europe’s “lead by example” approach failed to attract followers.
The EU cannot afford to isolate itself, or misunderstand the geopolitical forces at play, yet again.
Fortunately, the Council seems to have internalized this lesson, leaving open the possibility of reconsidering its commitments after COP21.
But it has a lot to&nbsp;do before then, not only to establish a unified approach, but also to translate that approach into strong tactics and a clear message at COP21.
Success would provide a strong foundation for the broader EU energy agenda.
If the EU is to address the key challenges of energy security, competitive pricing, and sustainability, it will need a unified, comprehensive, and compelling policy approach.
The foundations of such an approach – an internal energy market, the framework of an energy union, and a cohesive external voice – are emerging.
Now Europe needs to follow through and make it work.
Europe, An Engine of Peace
Critics of European monetary integration often point out that, in the absence of political union, monetary union is doomed to fail.
I agree with the critics’ conclusion, but not with their premise, for the success of the single currency so far has been due precisely to the political commitments of the Union’s member countries.
In other words, it is not true that the European Union does not constitute a political union.
European economic integration – in all its aspects – reflects the desire to integrate Europe politically, which, at least in my view, implies that European economic and monetary integration is irreversible.
This has been true from the outset of the European integration process in 1952, when six countries established the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC).
The aim of the ECSC was explicitly political: to remove control of the two most important raw materials for the production of heavy weaponry from states that had just fought the bloodiest war in history.
This drive for peace remained, quietly, the key motivation behind further steps toward Europe’s economic integration, which was regarded as the vehicle for achieving political integration.&nbsp;
In 1951, French Prime Minister Rene Pléven proposed establishing a European Defense Community (EDC) alongside the ECSC.
He failed, but the idea did not vanish.
Later that year, Robert Schumann – the French foreign minister at the time and a founding father of European integration – explicitly identified the ECSC with the drive for peace.
He described it as a means for creating a “fusion of interests…that will be the leavening from which may grow a wider and deeper community between countries long opposed to one another by bloody conflicts.”
These words were echoed on the eve of the introduction of the single currency.
In particular, Germany under Chancellor Helmut Kohl often linked monetary integration with the objective of political union.
Kohl once referred to the single currency’s success as a matter of “war and peace.”
For this reason, I do not agree with those who argue that Germany’s support for European monetary integration was the price it paid for Europe’s acceptance of German reunification.
On the contrary, the historical record shows that Germany made the case for a parallel drive to monetary and political integration well before the fall of the Iron Curtain.
Of course, there are other motives behind support for economic integration.
The EU’s leaders are convinced that achieving the so-called four freedoms – i.e., freedom of movement of goods, services, capital, and people – will optimize the well-being of Europe’s population.
They also aspire to increase the Continent’s strategic power.
But peace was the principal driving force in the minds of people like Schumann and Jean Monnet at the beginning of the European integration process, as it was for Helmut Schmidt and Valéry Giscard d’Estaing when they laid the foundations of the single currency and today’s European Central Bank.
For half a century, the process of European integration proceeded – sometimes with setbacks, sometimes with giant steps forward – joining formerly separate markets by creating very close trade relations.
Over time, this stimulated ever-greater economic convergence.
Of course, Europe’s economies have not become “look-alikes,” nor has GDP per capita been fully equalized.
But the differences between Europe’s economies were never so dramatic as to form an insurmountable barrier to embarking upon the most ambitious project of all: adopting a common currency.
Understanding this history is vital, because Europe’s Union once again stands at a threshold: should it keep its promise to start membership talks with Turkey?
In the wake of the defeat of the EU’s Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands this spring, many say that Europe’s decade-old promise cannot and should not be kept.
What strikes me as dangerous is that the issue of peace – the motor that has driven European integration from the start – rarely comes up in the debate about what to do in the wake of these events.
On the contrary, responsible statesmen and party leaders have come out openly against Turkish membership.
I would have hoped that these people had learned from Schumann and Monnet what really matters for Europe and its future; sadly, this does not seem to be the case.
Of course, I do not fear some sort of military clash between Turkey and the EU.
After all, Turkey has been and remains a loyal member of NATO.
But an increasingly virulent and violent clash of cultures is emerging in Europe – particularly in France, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands – between Islam and the humanitarian, Christian, and Jewish traditions.
For me, Europe’s integration of Muslim Turkey into its political union is the same sort of question of peace that Schumann and Monnet successfully confronted.
Today, Europe needs peace between cultures as much as it once needed peace between nations, and it is for this reason that we must welcome Turkey into our midst.
The EU’s Bold New Strategy
BRUSSELS – When problems accumulate, as in Europe – where the failed coup in Turkey comes hard on the heels of the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union – attention is often focused on the most recent issue to arise.
Earlier problems, now seeming less urgent, are neglected.
For many years, we Europeans have seen how this plays out: in the end, none of the problems ever seems to be resolved.
The Turkish coup appears now to be resolving itself, though no one yet knows what long-term implications it will have for that vital country.
Brexit is, without doubt, a veritable blow to the European project.
A member state has regrettably chosen to move ahead alone. But this mustn’t lead the EU into the most damaging situation of all: paralysis.
The many issues that the Union must still resolve won’t disappear merely with the passage of time.
And one of the most urgent is Europe’s security: each day that passes without taking joint action is an opportunity lost and leads to greater risk.
Addressing such issues effectively, rather than falling into the trap of the immediate, requires adhering to accepted strategies.
By identifying challenges, establishing long-term objectives, and designing collective action to achieve those objectives, strategies provide a framework for initiatives to address problems in a more far-sighted, coherent way.
With this in mind, Federica Mogherini, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, and her team have designed and presented a Global Strategy for European security that has clearly defined aims befitting conditions both within and beyond our borders.
Many observers have indicated that now is not the best time to elaborate a vision that assumes that all Europeans are united by common interests.
But, as the strategy clearly declares, cooperation is no longer a question of principle; it is an existential imperative.
That is why I disagree with those who call the Global Strategy ill-timed and even useless.
Even though it was presented to the European Council a week after the Brexit referendum, its aim is to implement the provisions foreseen in the Treaty of Lisbon, seven years after the treaty entered into effect.
It is also the result of a June 2015 mandate from the European Council itself.
And it aims to develop a policy to strengthen the EU, which many citizens want.
To remain immobile would have been a grave error.
The Global Strategy defines clear objectives, considers the mistakes of the past, and is deeply anchored in the EU’s present-day reality.
It calls for a more responsible, united, and credible EU – the only response capable of overcoming Euroskepticism.
It defines the actions Europe must take and the capacities it must have for its own defense and security.
It takes into account the long-term effects of its actions and understands that the development of the EU’s member states is essential to conflict prevention.
And it recognizes that only greater unity will enable Europe to confront the challenges of terrorism, migration, and climate change.
A fundamental fact should be borne in mind when assessing the Global Strategy’s usefulness: The threats to Europe’s security are not common because some treaty or intergovernmental consensus has said so.
They are common because we are neighbors, and because, like it or not, the world around us is irremediably global.
One consequence of a document like the Global Strategy is the creation of a common discourse.
In 2003, Europeans also needed to unite behind a common foreign policy, following the differences created by the intervention in Iraq.
But the problem today is on a very different level: the European project itself is being questioned.
Revealing the EU’s capacity to act effectively would help to confirm the necessity of its existence.
The Global Strategy can be useful here.
European citizens perceive terrorism and the refugee tragedy as questions of vital importance and want the EU to play a greater role in addressing them and other global issues.
A Pew Research Center study in ten European countries (including supposed bastions of Euroskepticism like the UK, Poland, and Hungary) found that an average of 74% of those polled supported more decisive action by the EU abroad.
In recent years, we have seen how internal and external security conditions are closely linked.
That is why, in the interest of safeguarding internal security, the Global Strategy emphasizes the need for more and improved external action.
It is also why the EU requires an integral approach to conflicts and crises that uses every available instrument and policy.
Moreover, the manner in which we conduct external action characterizes us as Europeans.
In the field of human security, few organizations can deploy missions and operations as complete as the EU’s, combining military and civilian elements, such as police or judges.
Much has changed since the European Security Strategy of 2003: Europe must now find its place amid the competition of great powers and negotiate the conflicts and instability on its eastern and southern flanks.
There have been important changes within Europe as well, and opposition to strengthening the EU seems to be on the rise, as evidenced by the Brexit vote and the position recently expressed by the Visegrad Group (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia).
With the presentation of the Global Strategy, those in favor of moving the European project forward have placed an initiative on the table.
Without it, only proposals for less Europe would have been heard.
Over the coming months, we must move our foreign and security policy forward, in order to implement the strategy’s objectives.
Those of us who are in favor of continuing to advance cannot remain silent.
Europeanizing Europe
BERLIN – The eurozone is at the center of the global financial crisis, because only there, in the realm of the second most important currency after the dollar, does the crisis hit a weak “structure” rather than a state with real power.
It is a structure that is squandering the trust of citizens and markets in its ability to resolve conflicts – while pushing the international financial system to the brink of disaster.
In other words, the financial crisis now reflects a political crisis of the eurozone – one that calls into question the very existence of the European project as a whole.
If Europe’s monetary union fails, not much of the common market, or of European institutions and treaties, will be left.
We would have to write off six decades of successful European integration, with unknown consequences.
This failure would coincide with the emergence of a new world order, as two centuries of Western predominance come to an end.
Power and wealth are shifting towards East Asian and other emerging countries, while America will be preoccupied with its own problems and turning from the Atlantic towards the Pacific.
If Europeans don’t address their interests now, no one will do it for them.
If Europe today does not become the agent of its own destiny, it will become the object of new world powers.
The cause of the European crisis is not three decades of neo-liberalism. Nor is it the result of the collapse of a speculation-fueled asset bubble, the violation of the Maastricht criteria, ballooning debt, or greedy banks.
As important as all of these factors are, Europe’s problem is not what happened, but what did not happen: the creation of a common European government.
At the beginning of the 1990’s, when the majority of the European Union’s member states decided to form a monetary union with a common currency and a central bank, the idea of a central government lacked support.
As a result, that phase of the monetary union’s construction was postponed, leaving an impressive edifice that lacked a strong foundation to ensure stability in times of crisis.
Monetary sovereignty was made a common cause; but the power needed to exercise it remained in national capitals.
It was believed at the time that formalized rules – imposing mandatory limits on deficits, debt, and inflation – would be enough.
But this foundation of rules turned out to be an illusion: principles always need the support of power; otherwise they cannot stand the test of reality.
The eurozone, a confederation of sovereign states with a common currency and common principles and mechanisms, is now failing that test.
Unable to respond decisively to a crisis, the eurozone is losing the confidence that is any currency’s most important asset.
Unless political power in Europe is Europeanized, with the current confederation evolving into a federation, the eurozone – and the EU as a whole – will disintegrate.
The political, economic, and financial costs of renationalization would be enormous; an EU collapse is feared around the world for good reason.
By contrast, if the currency union’s political deficit is addressed now, first by establishing a fiscal union (a common budget and common liabilities), a real political federation will be possible.
And let us be clear: anything less than a United States of Europe will not be powerful enough to prevent the looming disaster.
Like it or not, the eurozone will have to act as the EU’s avant-garde, because the EU as a whole, with its 27 member states, will be neither willing nor able to accelerate political unification.
Unfortunately, unanimous support for the necessary EU treaty changes simply could not be secured.
So, what should be done?
Europeans made decisive progress on integration outside the scope of the EU treaties (but very much in the European spirit) when they agreed to open their borders with the so-called Schengen Agreement (today a part of the EU treaties).
Drawing on that successful experience, the eurozone should avoid the EU’s original sin of creating a supra-national structure that lacked democratic legitimization.
The eurozone needs a government, which, as things stand at the moment, can consist only of the respective heads of state and government – a development that has already started.
And, because there can be no fiscal union without a common budget policy, nothing can be decided without the national parliaments.
This means that a “European Chamber,” comprising national parliaments’ leaders, is indispensable.
Initially, such a chamber could be an advisory body, with the national parliaments maintaining their competencies; later, on the basis of an intergovernmental treaty, it must become a real parliamentary control and decision-making body, made up of national parliaments’ delegated members.
Of course, because a treaty of this kind would mean extensive transfer of sovereignty to European intergovernmental institutions, it would need direct popular legitimization through referendums in all member states, including (and especially) Germany.
None of this addresses important questions, such as common policies to ensure economic stability and promote growth.
But, if we have learned anything from the current crisis, it is that such issues cannot even be framed unless and until the eurozone has a reliable institutional framework, with a sturdy foundation consisting of a real government, effective parliamentary control, and genuine democratic legitimization.
Europe at War
NEW YORK – By invading Ukraine in 2014, President Vladimir Putin’s Russia has posed a fundamental challenge to the values and principles on which the European Union was founded, and to the rules-based system that has kept the peace in Europe since 1945.
Neither Europe’s leaders nor its citizens are fully aware of the scope of this challenge, much less how to deal with it.
Putin’s regime is based on rule by force, manifested in repression at home and aggression abroad.
But it has been able to gain a tactical advantage, at least in the short term, over the EU and the United States, which are determined to avoid direct military confrontation.
Violating its treaty obligations, Russia annexed Crimea and established separatist enclaves in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.
When it appeared last summer that the Ukrainian government might win the war in Donbas, Putin ordered an invasion by regular Russian armed forces.
Preparations for a second wave of military action began in November, when Putin provided separatists with a new influx of armored columns and personnel.
The West, sadly, has provided embattled Ukraine with only a façade of support.
Equally disturbing has been the continuing reluctance of international leaders to provide new financial commitments to Ukraine, despite growing pressure on its foreign-currency reserves and the specter of a full-blown financial meltdown.
As a result, the mere threat of military action may be sufficient to bring about Ukraine’s economic collapse.
Putin seems to be holding out the prospect of a grand bargain, with Russia helping in the fight against the Islamic State – for example, by not supplying S300 missiles to Syria (thus preserving US air domination) – in exchange for the US giving Russia control over its so-called “near abroad.”
Should US President Barack Obama accept such a deal, the entire structure of international relations would be dangerously altered in favor of the use of force.
That would be a tragic mistake, with far-reaching geopolitical consequences.
The collapse of Ukraine would be a tremendous loss for NATO and indirectly for the EU and the US.
A victorious Russia would pose a potent threat to the Baltic states, with their large ethnic Russian populations.
Instead of supporting Ukraine, NATO would have to defend itself on its own soil, exposing both the EU and the US to the danger they have been so eager to avoid: direct military confrontation with Russia.
The threat to the EU’s political cohesion is even greater than the military risk.
The euro crisis has transformed an ever-closer union of equal sovereign states, willingly sacrificing a share of their independence for the common good, into an association of creditor and debtor countries, with the debtors struggling to meet the creditors’ terms.
This new EU is neither equal nor voluntary.
In fact, for many young people in the debtor countries, the EU seems like a foreign oppressor.
And about 30% of the recently elected European Parliament ran on anti-European platforms.
It is this internal weakness that has allowed Putin’s Russia – which, on its own, is far from attractive – to emerge as a potent rival to the EU.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has gone so far as to cite Putin as his role model – and he is no anomaly.
Neither Europe’s leaders nor its citizens seem to recognize that Russia’s attack on Ukraine is indirectly an assault on the EU and its principles of governance.
It should be clear that it is inappropriate for a country, or association of countries, at war to pursue fiscal austerity, as the EU continues to do.
All available resources should be put to work in the war effort, even if that requires running up budget deficits.
Europe is fortunate that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has behaved as a true European with regard to the threat posed by Russia.
The foremost advocate of sanctions, she has been more willing to defy German public opinion and business interests on the issue than on any other.
But Germany has also been the main advocate of fiscal austerity, and Merkel needs to understand the contradiction between these positions.
Sanctions against Russia are necessary, but they are not without repercussions.
European economies, including Germany, are suffering, as the sanctions’ depressive impact aggravates the recessionary and deflationary forces that are already at work.
By contrast, helping Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression would have a stimulative effect on Ukraine and Europe.
The EU’s members are at war – and they need to start acting like it.
That means modifying their commitment to fiscal austerity and recognizing that they are better off helping Ukraine to defend itself than hoping that they will not have to defend the EU themselves.
Ukraine needs an immediate cash injection of, say, $20 billion, with a promise of more when needed, in order to stave off a financial collapse.
The International Monetary Fund could provide these funds, as it did previously, with the EU promising to match the IMF’s contribution.
Actual expenditures would remain under the IMF’s control and subject to the implementation of far-reaching structural reforms.
In Ukraine, there is one more factor working in the EU’s favor: the country’s new leadership is determined to correct previous governments’ corruption, mismanagement, and abuses.
Indeed, it has already created a detailed strategy to cut household gas consumption by more than half, with the goal of dispersing the corrupt gas monopoly of Naftogaz and ending Ukraine’s energy dependence on Russia.
The “new Ukraine” is resolutely pro-European, and ready to defend Europe by defending itself.
But its enemies – not only Putin’s Russia, but also its own bureaucracy and financial oligarchy – are formidable, and it cannot defeat them alone.
Supporting the new Ukraine in 2015 and beyond is the most cost-effective investment the EU could make.
It could even help the EU recapture the spirit of unity and shared prosperity that led to its creation.
In short, by saving Ukraine, the EU could also save itself.
The Price of European Indifference
BAGHDAD – Europe’s migration debate has taken a disturbing turn.
It began with the creation of the catch-all concept (a legal freak) of a “migrant,” which obscures the difference, central to the law, between economic and political migration, between people escaping poverty and those driven from their homes by war.
Unlike economic migrants, those fleeing oppression, terror, and massacre have an inalienable right to asylum, which entails an unconditional obligation by the international community to provide shelter.
Even when the distinction is acknowledged, it is often as part of another sleight of hand, an attempt to convince credulous minds that the men, women, and children who paid thousands of dollars to travel on one of the rickety boats washing up on the islands of Lampedusa or Kos are economic migrants.
The reality, however, is that 80% of these people are refugees, attempting to escape despotism, terror, and religious extremism in countries like Syria, Eritrea, and Afghanistan.
That is why international law requires that the cases of asylum-seekers are examined not in bulk, but one by one.
And even when that is accepted, when the sheer number of people clamoring to get to Europe’s shores makes it all but impossible to deny the barbarity driving them to flee, a third smokescreen goes up.
Some, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, claim that the conflicts generating these refugees rage only in Arab countries that are being bombed by the West.
Here again, the figures do not lie.
The top source of refugees is Syria, where the international community has refused to conduct the kinds of military operations required by the “responsibility to protect” – even though international law demands intervention when a mad despot, having killed 240,000 of his people, undertakes to empty his country.
Jordan, with a population of 6.5 million, has taken in nearly 700,000.
Meanwhile, Europe, in a display of united selfishness, has scuttled a plan to relocate a mere 40,000 asylum-seekers from their cities of refuge in Italy and Greece.
Second, the minority who do choose Germany, France, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, or Hungary are not enemies who have come to destroy us or even to sponge off of European taxpayers.
They are applicants for freedom, lovers of our promised land, our social model, and our values.
They are people who cry out “Europe!
Europe!” the way millions of Europeans, arriving a century ago on Ellis Island, learned to sing “America the Beautiful.”
Then there is the ugly rumor that this imaginary assault has been clandestinely orchestrated by the strategists of a “great replacement,” with foreigners supplanting native Europeans, or, worse, by agents of an international jihad, in which today’s migrants are tomorrow’s terrorists on bullet trains.
It should go without saying that this is nonsense.
Taken together, these distortions and delusions have had serious consequences.
For starters, the Mediterranean Sea has been all but abandoned to human smugglers.
The Mare Nostrum is gradually becoming the kind of vast and watery mass grave described by a faraway poet.
Some 2,350 people have drowned already this year.
But, for most Europeans, these people are little more than statistics, just as the women and men who have survived the journey remain unidentified and indistinguishable, a threatening anonymous mass.
Our society of the spectacle, normally so quick to manufacture an instant celebrity to serve as the “face” of the crisis du jour (anything from swine flu to a truckers’ strike), has not taken an interest in the fate of a single one of the “migrants.”
These individuals – whose course to Europe resembles that of the Phoenician Princess Europa, who arrived from Tyre on Zeus’s back several millennia ago – are being wholly rejected; indeed, walls are being constructed to keep them out.
The result is another group of people being denied basic rights.
Such people, as Hannah Arendt once observed, will ultimately come to see in the commission of a crime their only path into the world of law and of those who enjoy the rights the law confers.
Europe, harassed by its xenophobes and consumed by self-doubt, has turned its back on its values.
Indeed, it has forgotten what it is.
The bell tolls not only for the migrants, but also for a Europe whose humanistic patrimony is crumbling before our very eyes.
Europe’s Jihadi Generation
MADRID ‒ He came from Algeria seeking a better life, anticipating an escape from poverty, oppression, and hopelessness.
In Paris, he found a low-skill job and had children and grandchildren.
As French citizens, they had the right to an education and health care.
But they grew up in the ghettos that ring France’s major cities, surrounded by families like theirs, literally on the margins of society.
Unable to integrate fully, they had few opportunities for economic advancement.
Paradise was never gained.
This story has been repeated millions of times in the countries of Western Europe, with immigrants and their families ending up poor and excluded.
In the worst-case scenario, they are recruited by extremist groups that seem to offer what they are missing: a sense of belonging, identity, and purpose.
After a lifetime of marginalization, participation in a larger cause can seem worth the lies, self-destruction, and even death that inclusion demands.
In the wake of the attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris and the thwarting of another attack in Belgium, Europe needs to take a good look at itself.
It must recognize that second- and third-generation immigrants are susceptible to the blandishments of terrorist organizations because European citizenship has not translated into social and economic inclusion.
If anything, growing inequality – exacerbated by years of crisis – is making the problem worse.
People need hope.
They need to believe in a vision, a project that promises a better future for them and their communities.
European countries once offered that sense of hope.
But the crisis, and the official response to it, has replaced hope with frustration and disillusionment.
This has created fertile ground for anti-immigrant populists and Islamist terrorists alike.
More than 1,200 French citizens are estimated to have joined the jihadi cause in Syria, along with 600 from the United Kingdom, 550 from Germany, and 400 from Belgium.
Other European countries, including Spain, are experiencing a similar phenomenon.
And some European citizens, like the Charlie Hebdo assassins, have acted at home.
While intelligence services and police forces must be engaged to prevent attacks, devising an effective strategy to counteract extremist movements requires, first and foremost, understanding what drives them.
Western countries must go beyond defending freedom of speech and improving police coordination to develop lasting solutions that address adherents’ economic and social marginalization, while avoiding cultural confrontation and reliance on repression alone.
More fundamentally, such solutions require abandoning the false dichotomy of liberty and security.
If security concerns trump basic rights and freedoms, fanaticism will have scored a victory; and the same thing will happen if expressions of Islamophobia and xenophobia increase.
A week after the Paris attacks, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reiterated the sentiment expressed by former President Christian Wulff in 2010: standing beside Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, Merkel declared that Islam is as much a part of Germany as Judaism and Christianity.
This statement represents the right way forward.
Muslim immigrants, whether first-, second-, or third-generation, must be able to integrate fully into European society, gaining the same opportunities as Europe’s other residents and citizens.
That principle should be applied at the global level as well, through the establishment of an inclusive framework that fosters development – and encourages the rejection of fanaticism – in the Islamic world.
The aggressive fundamentalism and infighting that held down Christian societies for centuries has been relegated to the past, and that is where it must remain.
A religion is not only a belief system; it is also an institution, a language, and even a kind of market actor, competing for supporters.
Radical terrorist groups attempt to consolidate their distorted version of “true” Islam as the only institution, imposing their language to win the entire Muslim market.
Today, groups like the Islamic State and Nigeria’s Boko Haram have joined Al Qaeda in a struggle to attract Muslims from all over the world, thereby securing their leadership in global jihad.
These groups take advantage of unruly environments and weak or collapsing institutions to gain a territorial foothold.
Indeed, it was the failed transitions in Syria, Libya, and Yemen after the Arab Spring revolts that fueled the Islamic State’s emergence.
Millions of young people, though disillusioned by decades of social paralysis, unemployment, and brutal dictatorships, had dared to expect better.
Though Tunisians have made progress, the other affected populations, like many Muslim immigrants in Europe, have had their hopes shattered.
Jihad, like any other reductionist political program, is capable of seducing a wide variety of people.
The attribute they almost always share is a sense of futility or a lack of purpose.
The West must recognize that, as Afghanistan and Iraq have shown, conflict in the Arab world cannot be resolved through foreign military intervention.
The only way to restore order and spur progress in the region is by empowering moderate Muslims, so that they can triumph over the forces of radicalism and violence.
The West’s role is to identify them and offer them acceptance and support.
This lesson should be applied both abroad and at home.
Europe’s Clash of Generations
LONDON – As Europe’s financial crisis goes from acute to chronic, the dispute over who will bear the costs of resolving it is fueling the emergence of a new generation of political movements.
In the so-called periphery, political upstarts promise citizens an alternative to austerity.
In the eurozone’s “core” countries, they purport to protect taxpayers from relentless demands for debtor-country relief.
How Europe’s leaders respond to these new political challengers will determine whether the monetary union stabilizes or fractures.
Europe’s political elite have, for the most part, been strongly integrationist.
Given that they are largely of the post-World War II generation, they are acutely aware of the benefits of a peaceful Europe.
In the 1990’s, differing visions of European integration led to a problematic compromise.
In order to secure France’s backing for German reunification, Germany agreed to create a monetary union – but not a fiscal union.
Now, Europe is suffering the consequences of that Faustian bargain.
At the same time, Europe’s leaders are under pressure from a new generation of voters, who grew up in the shadow of the Berlin Wall’s collapse.
The lifting of the Iron Curtain gave the West access to a vast supply of cheap labor in Eastern Europe.
China’s subsequent emergence expanded that supply further, culminating with China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001.
As a result, many of Europe’s economies began to fall behind.
European leaders hoped that a monetary union would help Europe’s less competitive economies catch up to the richer countries of the north.
And, during its first decade, the euro ostensibly delivered.
Just as cheap mortgage financing papered over the cracks of growing income inequality in the United States, cheap capital from the north accelerated Europe’s apparent economic convergence.
The post-Wall generation seemed to have all the luck – at least for a while.
But income inequality was worsening steadily in all member countries, with more highly educated citizens benefiting from the booming services industry, while the less educated suffered as manufacturing moved to cheaper locations.
Then, the global financial crisis struck, income inequality rose sharply, and the post-Wall generation in southern Europe suffered the largest drop in living standards since WWII.
Unlike the US, which was founded on a political cause – opposition to British colonialism – that forged a common national identity, countries joining the European Union sought simply to avoid further warfare on the continent.
While laudable, this cause was inadequate to foster a shared European identity.
On the contrary, it allowed national identity to flourish.
The post-Wall generation, whose members are less than 40 years old and thus far removed from WWII, has little appreciation for this cause.
For them, debtor and creditor countries’ increasingly divergent economic objectives are much more meaningful.
Citizens of debtor economies, who grew up complacent about economic convergence, have lost their savings and, in many cases, have run out of hope.
Meanwhile, citizens of creditor countries are focused on protecting the gains made before the crisis; after all, it was their savings that financed their neighbors’ reckless spending.
Throughout the eurozone, rising income inequality has created an underclass that is increasingly suspicious of the monetary union.
As the post-war generation ages – with most of its members now at least 60 years old and its leaders either in senior leadership positions or acting as senior statesmen – the remaining support for integration is waning.
Many post-Wall voters stand on the margins of established parties or are forming parties of their own, while a more pragmatic group is being pulled between the old order and new movements.
The muddled, reactive response to the euro crisis reflects the compromises that traditional political parties have made in order to remain in power as generational differences have become increasingly extreme.
Political revolutions rarely arise out of brief periods of acute crisis.
Rather, they follow one or more generations of chronic decline, when fear of economic loss gives way to targeted anger, and charismatic voices surface to orchestrate the response.
This pattern has recurred throughout history, from the French Revolution all the way to the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Although markets may have been cowed into submission for now, the cracks in the eurozone’s political foundations are beginning to show.
