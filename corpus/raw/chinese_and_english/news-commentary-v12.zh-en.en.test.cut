but arguments about whether limit should 60 gdp more miss larger point
nineteen years experience maastricht treaty created both eu euro shown convincingly such limits unenforceable
countries clout flaunt limits will do so whenever politically convenient
debt crisis near exceptions will found waivers will issued buyers additional debt will lined up
so question what do when debt gets near its limit however high low
how prevent debt getting near limit first place except very extreme unusual circumstances
need fiscal rules
fiscal rule any pre specified mechanism constrains spending deficit
according study international monetary fund 80 countries around world use some kind fiscal rule
but fiscal rules created equal
too loose rule merely ornamental
too tight constitutional amendment requiring balanced budget example rule could create rather than solve problems think economic political chaos would ensue spain unemployment 21 were forced eliminate its huge fiscal deficit overnight
sweden chile almost poles apart geographically but both used sophisticated fiscal rules successfully
chile sets target its cyclically adjusted fiscal balance balance emerges after accounting deviations commodity prices domestic output their trends
when commodity prices boomed middle last decade rule called huge budget surpluses chile achieved repaying almost its public debt accumulating sizable rainy day fund
when financial crisis came chile was able mount aggressive fiscal stimulus without so much hiccup financial markets
course no fiscal rule account contingencies
why need independent fiscal council administer just need independent central bank pursue inflation targeting monetary rule
agreeing composition such council europe would hard but no harder than was agree makeup ecb board
eurobonds plus fiscal rules formula euro best hope salvation
unfortunately another crisis two might necessary before european leaders consider seriously
europe easy money endgame
munich euro brought balance payments crisis europe just gold standard did 1920s
fact there only difference between two episodes during today crisis huge international rescue packages been available
these rescue packages relieved eurozone financial distress but high cost
only they enabled investors avoid paying their poor decisions they also given overpriced southern european countries opportunity defer real depreciation form reduction relative prices goods
necessary restore competitiveness was destroyed euro initial years when caused excessive inflation
indeed countries like greece portugal spain regaining competitiveness would require them lower prices their own products relative rest eurozone about compared beginning crisis
italy probably needs reduce its relative prices
but portugal italy so far failed deliver any such real depreciation while relative prices greece spain fallen only respectively
revealingly crisis countries only ireland managed turn corner
reason obvious its bubble already burst end before any rescue funds were available
ireland was its own so had no option but implement massive austerity measures reducing its product prices relative other eurozone countries 13 peak trough
today ireland unemployment rate falling dramatically its manufacturing sector booming
relative terms greece received most europe bailout money showed largest increase unemployment
official loans granted country european central bank international community increased more than sixfold during past five years €53 billion 58 billion february 2010 €324 billion 181 gdp now
nevertheless unemployment rate more than doubled 26
there four possible economic policy responses state affairs
first europe could become transfer union north giving more more credit south later waiving
second south deflate
third north inflate
fourth countries no longer competitive exit europe monetary union depreciate their new currency
each path associated serious complications
first creates permanent dependence transfers sustaining relative prices prevents economy regaining competitiveness
second path drives many debtors crisis countries into bankruptcy
third expropriates creditor countries north
fourth may cause contagion effects via capital markets possibly forcing policymakers introduce capital controls cyprus 2013
european politics focused so far providing public credit crisis countries near zero interest rates eventually may morph into transfers
but now ecb attempting break impasse through quantitative easing qe
ecb stated goal reflate eurozone thereby reducing euro external value purchasing more than €1.1 trillion worth assets
according ecb president mario draghi inflation rate currently stands just below raised average just below
would offer southern european countries way out their competitiveness trap because prices remained unchanged south while northern countries inflated southern countries could gradually reduce their goods relative prices without feeling too much pain
course case north needs inflate faster than just
say southern europe kept its inflation rate france inflated rate germany would inflate good rest eurozone annually reach eurozone average slightly less than
pattern would continue about ten years bring eurozone back into balance
point germany price level would about 50 higher than today
i do expect qe bring about some inflation
given exchange rate relative price currency more euros come into circulation their value fall substantially establish new equilibrium currency market
experience similar programs united states united kingdom japan shown qe unleashes powerful forces depreciation
qe eurozone will thus bring about inflation draghi wants via higher import export prices
whether effect will sufficient revitalize southern europe remains seen
there risk japan china us will sit their hands while euro loses value world possibly even sliding into currency war
moreover southern eu countries instead leaving prices unchanged could abandon austerity issue ever greater volume new bonds stimulate economy
competitiveness gains rebalancing would fail materialize after initial flash pan eurozone would return permanent crisis
euro finally fully discredited would meet very messy end
only hope scenario does come pass southern countries stay course austerity
their last chance
europe america drumbeat war iran
america capital once again abuzz talk war only latest strategy victory iraq but now also military action against iran
harder becomes discern any rationality bush administration actions louder rumor mill grinds
will bush order air special forces attack iran
ever since bush state union address end january hardly day passed without something happening connection iran without bush administration ratcheting up its rhetoric
clearly us also pressing ahead preparations air strike
a more extensive military commitment scarcely possible given how overstretched us ground forces already
indeed confrontation iranians iraq visibly intensifying may gathering strength elsewhere well
bomb directed iranian revolutionary guard recently exploded iran border afghanistan
there course new attempts united states drum up evidence iranian threat may justify attack
bluff
world could perhaps calmly wait answer but fact progress iran nuclear program approaching end president bush term might create incalculable dynamic its own
iraq america strength may enough start war but win
but consequences military adventure iran would far surpass those war iraq
doing things halves yet again middle east would worst possible options bad region bad its neighbors
first among neighbors affected would europe
so how europe its vital security interests stake responded these developments
british prime minister tony blair already adapted us administration new confrontational rhetoric
french president jacques chirac unguardedly speculated iran two nuclear bombs might pose serious threat given possibility nuclear retaliation 45;&#45 his musings so startled french officials they quickly jumped correct president comments
german chancellor angela merkel gives speeches security conferences find favor america but otherwise germany prefers stay background
across europe risk avoidance seems order day even expense common interest nato solidarity
german navy defending lebanese coast against hezbollah while other european nations bear brunt policing lebanon ground
afghanistan germany its strong military presence north been turning deaf ear calls help canadian allies fighting revived taliban south
germany now wants send some tornado jets reconnaissance purposes better than nothing but much
terms security policy europe stagnating regressing very moment when unity needed more ever
big three europe germany current eu president particular must find way act together strategic security matters
they don’t europe will largely cease matter when going gets rough
going now getting quite rough iran persian gulf
should iran attacked year consequences will borne first foremost region but also europe middle east immediate western neighbor they will felt long time come
indeed europe will share costs iran prevails becomes nuclear power
so there much stake old continent
precise two overriding eu security interests stake avoiding war iran preventing iran becoming nuclear power
these two apparently contradictory interests reconciled translated into common strategy adopting three pronged approach based efficient isolation effective containment direct negotiations
europeans led merkel blair chirac should agree assure us europe ready pay high perhaps very high economic price taking decisive action intensify sanctions against iran
but they should offer only two strict preconditions military option taken off table parties involved including us enter into direct negotiations iran
policy isolation coupled direct negotiations would strengthened further common strategy toward syria aimed regime change but coalition change drawing syria away its close alliance iran
was both right important eu council foreign ministers agreed sanctions against iran
faced threat financial sanctions iran political elite increasingly realizing price its confrontational course
imperative further process resolute manner while same time rejecting military adventurism
up europe prevent two worst developments iran war nuclear armament acting jointly determination
vital european transatlantic interests stake
thus europe responsibility especially germany current eu president act now
europe under siege
brussels many europeans feel like their countries under assault huge numbers migrants flow across their borders
whether they being exposed refugees firsthand just seeing images them splashed across newspaper pages europeans well aware vast numbers desperate people trying enter european union territory any means possible
but awareness yet translate into unified response
tensions among member states seem rising perhaps because problem differs so greatly across countries
per capita basis sweden receives times more asylum applications than united kingdom where official policy toward refugees remains most hostile
germany now become main destination overall receiving nearly 40 eu total even per capita basis several times more than eu average
course there clear rules about how responsibility refugees delineated according so called dublin regulation first eu member state into refugee crosses responsible person asylum application
but clearly problematic puts entire burden refugees eu frontier countries
though may been huge problem 1990s when eu countries received only 300,000 asylum applications annually cannot work year when total expected triple number
smaller border countries like hungary greece simply do capacity register house hundreds thousands asylum seekers
larger countries like italy incentive overlook large numbers refugees landing their shores knowing nothing done those refugees will likely head elsewhere mainly northern europe
germany recognizing dublin system untenable now decided process asylum applications syrians regardless where they crossed into eu
decision was likely driven least partly how difficult given eu porous internal borders determine where refugee first entered
2013 ruling european court justice germany could return iranian refugee greece where applicant was found face real risk being subjected inhuman degrading treatment probably heightened germany sense responsibility issue
germany largest eu member country terms population gdp so some extent does make sense take lead
but germany still accounts less than fifth eu population less than quarter its economy
other words even germany handle europe refugees today
few months ago european commission tried its hand resolving problem courageous proposal distribute refugees across member states according simple equation accounts population gdp
but plan was rejected member states particularly those fewest refugees claiming represented undue interference domestic affairs
put eu its usual quandary everybody recognizes there problem but solution requires unanimity cannot achieved because each country defends only its own interests
only way forward leave out countries most averse accepting immigrants least temporarily create solution involving just those willing share burden
may seem fair but more refugees landing europe borders every day eu leaders cannot afford delay action
but there another dimension crisis makes addressing more complicated
migrants conflict areas like syria thus do according international law right asylum
there also plenty economic migrants say poorer parts balkans hoping escape poverty home willing misuse asylum system process
lodging application even without any chance being accepted appealing because until rejected applicant receives basic housing social services including health care pocket money amount may well exceed wages his her home country
spending few months northern europe while asylum application processed far more attractive than going home job pays barely livable wage no job
number asylum seekers increases so does time takes process their applications making system more tempting economic migrants
indeed close half asylum seekers germany now come safe countries like serbia albania macedonia
europe populists use such cases welfare tourism sow fear anger among european public reaching agreement accommodate actual refugees becomes increasingly difficult
against background eu needs take action two fronts
first member countries must urgently boost their capacity deal asylum applications so they quickly identify those who deserve protection
second eu needs improve burden sharing ideally among countries but perhaps among smaller group first providing shelter those who gain asylum
international law basic morality demands nothing less
turning off dividend spigot
new york european banks high litigation restructuring costs resulted major losses their books abysmal stock market performance
industry european regulators now reflect dismal state affairs search solutions they should consider banks revenue distribution including employee bonuses shareholder dividends part problem
revenue distribution primary reason european banks capital shortfalls
understand why should look back october 2014 when european banking authority began balance sheet stress tests eurozone largest 123 banks found capital shortfall €25 billion 28 billion them
time eba required banks devise plans address their respective shortfalls within months
some banks took action raised equity through rights issues sometimes substantial help governments
but most banks mollified regulators simply shedding riskier assets improve their capital ratios
needless say these efforts were ineffective european banks share prices declined 50 average since initial 2014 assessment
banks failed stress test didn’t take result seriously partly blame but so too regulators who did sufficiently hold banks feet fire improve their balance sheets who may applied stress tests were too weak detect financial frailty
eba conducted another series stress tests reported results late july
latest round looked 51 banks contrary previous tests was designed identify capital shortfalls but rather provide a common analytical framework consistently compare assess resilience large eu banks adverse economic developments
regulators now suppose european banking sector resilient adverse shocks
same day eba announcement worst performer italy banca monte dei paschi di siena announced €5 billion 5.6 billion new funding pursuant its €5.6 billion capital requirement
still market reaction announcement was negative eurostoxx banks index fell 7.5 two days most likely because eba did include specific estimates european banks capital shortfalls outline recapitalization plan
new paper investigating market reaction using united states capital requirement rules calculate total capital shortfall 51 participating banks €123 billion
despite large capital shortfall 28 34 publicly listed banks stress test paid out about €40 billion dividends 2015 meaning they distributed average over 60 their earnings shareholders
dividend payments made under capitalized banks amount substantial wealth transfer subordinated bondholders shareholders because bondholders who will suffer losses crisis
moreover potentially wealth transfer taxpayers private shareholders because under new banking rules government bailouts possible after bondholders covered bailed bank equity liabilities
contrast undercapitalized banks us forced halt forms capital distribution they fail stress test
fortunately following 2016 round stress tests eba now also considering type regulatory sanction
thus competent authorities may also consider requesting changes institutions capital plan may take number forms such potential restrictions dividends required bank maintain agreed trajectory its capital planning adverse scenario
estimate european regulators had adopted approach forced banks stop paying dividends 2010 start sovereign debt crisis europe retained equity could paid more than 50 2016 capital shortfalls
figure above shows our calculated capital shortfalls using eba stress test adverse scenario losses cumulative dividends these banks distributed since 2010
dividends paid out some banks such bnp paribas barclays actually exceed current capital shortfalls while others such deutsche bank commerzbank société générale capital shortfalls far exceed dividends would been retained
latter banks would still require substantial capital issuances top dividend restrictions make up difference
nonetheless our findings suggest simple first step toward preventing bank capital erosion stop banks capital shortfalls paying dividends including internal dividends such employee bonuses
such policy would even require regulators broach topics like capital issuance bailouts bail ins some banks even already begun suspend dividend payments
left now european central bank enforce practice across eurozone
new year banking union
brussels five years after outbreak financial crisis europe economic political situation remains fragile
mild recession expected europe year unemployment rise
beyond deficit reduction need implement €120 billion 155 billion european investment plan deepen european single market unleash its growth potential
but also need other structural measures
european union must put end negative feedback loop between individual member states their national banking systems
between 2008 2011 eu taxpayers granted banks €4.5 trillion loans guarantees
some countries threat bank recapitalization public funds resulted drop market confidence huge rise interest rates
european central bank ecb taken decisive action break vicious circle
moreover there now consensus 17 eurozone countries need banking union accompany their common currency
european commission proposed single rulebook banks capital requirements mutual support between national deposit guarantee schemes europe wide rules resolving failing banks place main burden bank shareholders creditors taxpayers
june 29 european heads state government committed themselves creation single european supervisor banks eurozone
good news both financial stability public finances once single supervisor place supervision will more credible impartial important dealing ailing banks managing their return viability
european commission also put forward set legislative proposals establish single supervisory mechanism confer key supervisory tasks ecb
proposal must now amended approved soon possible european parliament council ministers chance activating european stability mechanism esm proceeding other essential pillars banking union
further work however still needed several areas
scope new supervisory mechanism
some member states favor restricting european supervision systemically important banks
but commission believes should cover 6,000 banks eurozone
after systemically important impossible define
failures banks like northern rock dexia bankia reminders small medium size banks endanger entire financial system
would inherently unstable two supervisory mechanisms banks operating same market.the participation non eurozone countries new supervisory scheme
commission proposal confers powers ecb supervision banks eurozone
non eurozone countries proposals provide mechanism join voluntary basis submit ecb authority
but eu treaties make complicated give these non eurozone countries full voting powers
i do see any political problem giving these countries full voice shaping decisions european supervisor but creativity will needed find legally sound fair solution.national supervisors role new system
clearly european council decided paradigm shift powers moving ecb
but national supervisors will members board will take key decisions they will prepare implement
current negotiations still fine tune roles european national supervisors but ultimate authority must rest ecb.non eurozone eu members do want join single supervisory mechanism
these countries expressed concerns about new powers conferred ecb
particular they question ecb's voting rights within european banking authority will remain charge developing single rulebook 27 countries eu single market enhancing convergence supervisory practices
need find ways preserve fully influence non eurozone countries within european banking authority.democratic accountability ecb new supervisory powers
ecb must course maintain its full monetary policy independence despite its new role
so key question how addition giving important role european parliament national parliaments play their part overseeing supervisory decisions.timing
according some eu countries commission proposal too ambitious enter into force beginning 2013
but effective single banking supervisor prerequisite esm direct recapitalization banks
only possibility strong unified supervision will europe position break vicious circle between banks balance sheet weakness sovereign debt thus resolve eurozone crisis.entry into force january 2013 would bring about supervision ecb banks received requested public funding
only july 2013 would banks major systemic importance subject ecb supervision
remaining banks would subject new mechanism start 2014
intense discussions normal such high stakes project
countries like germany finland netherlands right argue rapid progress cannot come expense new supervisory structure quality
but eu countries stick commitment they made june strike deal time gradual entry into force january 2013
europe emerging bubbles
munich european central bank latest policy moves shocked many observers
while goal prevent deflation spur growth clear policies themselves setting stage severe instability
policies question include setting interest rate ecb main refinancing operations zero raising monthly asset purchases €20 billion 22.3 billion €80 billion pushing interest rate money banks deposit ecb further into negative territory 0.40
inflationary credit bubble spurred southern european countries persistence lower interest rates undermined their competitiveness drove asset property prices unsustainably high levels
when bubble burst ecb tried prevent excessive prices returning their equilibrium levels using its printing press promising unlimited coverage investors latest ecb measures just more same
course when financial crisis erupted full force 2008 following collapse us investment bank lehman brothers ecb interventions were justified
but after global economy started recover during latter part following year ecb moves became increasingly problematic because they enabled countries evade structural reform hindered necessary disinflation southern eurozone countries even halted altogether portugal italy
southern europe had succumbed drug cheap credit
but when private credit stalled symptoms withdrawal began appear ecb provided replacement drugs
instead treating addiction created junkie economies were unable function without fix
japan made similar mistake when its property bubble burst 1990
over two decades bank japan flooded economy money near zero interest rates
japanese government its part followed such relentless policy deficit spending public debt jumped 67 gdp 246 gdp today latest upward push provided dubious abenomics economic strategy being pursued prime minister shinzo abe government
none helped because neither monetary nor fiscal policy substitute structural reform
contrary more keynesian monetarist drugs administered feebler self healing power markets weaker willingness policymakers impose painful detoxification treatments economy populace
but worst effects ecb policy may yet come eurozone still sound economies also become credit junkies
there already some worrying signs
property markets austria germany luxembourg practically exploded throughout crisis result banks chasing borrowers offers loans near zero interest rates regardless their creditworthiness
austria property prices risen nearly half since lehman collapse luxembourg they risen almost third
even germany europe largest economy been experiencing massive property boom since 2010 average urban property prices having risen more than third nearly half large cities
country undergoing construction boom seen since reunification
real estate agents only leftovers offer
german property boom could reined appropriate jump interest rates
but given ecb apparent determination head opposite direction bubble will only grow
bursts effects could dire euro new euro skeptic alternative germany party made astonishing headway country recent state elections would make sure
eurozone minsky conundrum
brussels stubbornly low inflation european central bank worried
but its response essentially just more quantitative easing could backfire exacerbating imbalances generating serious financial instability
stands headline consumer price index eurozone hovers around zero even core inflation remains below too far comfort ecb target around
while new round weakness global commodity prices earlier year contributed these figures does explain weakness longer term inflation expectations improved little since march when ecb started its massive €60 billion 66.3 billion per month bond buying program
but instead rethinking its strategy ecb considering doubling down buying even more bonds lowering its benchmark interest rate even further into negative territory would serious mistake
easier credit conditions lower interest rates supposed boost growth stimulating investment consumption demand
but core eurozone countries like germany netherlands credit been plentiful interest rates been close zero some time so there was never much chance bond purchases would significant impact there
indeed european commission most recent economic forecast shows spending core countries increased result ecb policies germany external surplus actually increasing
course highly indebted peripheral countries there was room interest rates fall credit supply grow they leading governments households increase their spending
while asymmetrical impact ecb policy appropriate principle because unemployment much higher periphery reality recovery supported least solvent economies sustainable
back 1986 hyman minsky warned about longer term dangers financial stability ponzi borrowers those who service their debt only new debt become main pillar economy
zero interest rate environment course ideal such borrowers because there nothing provide indication solvency borrowers just roll over their debt
but bad those strong asset position reducing their spending power spurs them save even more
standard response minsky concern spenders can’t afford savers aren’t spending monetary policy should focus ensuring price stability while macroprudential policy aims safeguard financial stability limiting borrowing highly indebted agents
but approach does work
macroprudential policy limited additional credit marginal borrowers effectively monetary policy would no impact demand long most solvent agents refuse spend more
problem arose united states after 2001 recession
although federal reserve kept interest rates low protracted period corporate sector did increase its investment
recovery was ultimately fueled so called subprime mortgages home purchase loans extended borrowers lower credit ratings
result know was mega bubble triggered 2008 financial crisis
eurozone case risk compounded ineffectiveness its key macroprudential instrument stability growth pact limiting countries spending lower interest rates give debtor countries leeway spend more
public debt share gdp rise italy spain even though both countries their eurozone partners committed reducing debt ratio
fact even without lower interest rates deficit limits pact imposes proved non binding exemplified france flouting them since 2009
short monetary policy perpetuating disequilibrium between creditor debtor economies eurozone macroprudential policy doing nothing stop
when interest rates normalize could generate serious financial instability
but conundrum ecb few options stimulating demand among eurozone more solvent agents thus supporting sustainable recovery
deciding its next move whether initiate more bond purchases lower interest rates even further do both ecb must recognize any positive impact demand probably will limited eurozone weaker economies economies least afford
high risk move probably justified effort bring price increases few dozen basis points closer ecb target
recovery already begun eurozone should left run its course
even more expansionary monetary policy stance might strengthen recovery marginally but cost increasing eurozone already dangerous imbalances
europe chimerical capital markets union
london eurozone's survival doubt again greece demands debt forgiveness end austerity else
but though europe's currency union risk its banking union remains early stage development endlessly creative european commission embarking another adventure so called capital markets union
so called appropriate because project despite being only vaguely defined point most certainly intended create single european capital market
indeed european union leaders know better than announce such ambition would require new treaty no prepared open up worms
after european voters no mood transfer more powers brussels
capital markets union actually began slogan coined eu commission president jean claude juncker's acolytes
now new financial markets commissioner united kingdom's lord jonathan hill been assigned unenviable task putting flesh bare bones
commission's green paper consultation round subject produced more questions than answers
think tanks lobby groups national regulators wasted no time trying influence hill's efforts head off any initiatives might damage their interests
bank england argued there should no replication banking union grant new powers european central bank expense national central banks
capital markets union boe argues does require institutional change so no super regulator should created
commission accepted conclusion now though hill's aides suggested some point…supervisory issues will pop up
fact establishing european version us securities exchange commission longstanding aim brussels eurocracy may achieved day but just yet
but before delving into institutional issues favorite topic eu veterans should consider what problem capital markets union supposed solve
here there considerable agreement
most regulators market participants agree europe's financial markets dysfunctional
banking assets amounting roughly 300 eu wide gdp compared some 70 united states large pools savings being left unused
moreover european companies receive excessive 80 their finance banks less than capital markets proportions roughly reversed us
need redress imbalance become increasingly evident since recent financial crisis banks efforts rebuild their capital bases meet stricter regulatory requirements led credit rationing
loosening constraint output growth would improve european economy's resilience encourage risk taking promote dynamism
overall aim capital markets union thus relatively straightforward
but achieving no small part because europe's heavy reliance bank finance stems structural cultural factors
remedies commission suggested so far example encouraging crowdfunding standardizing terms securitization appear unlikely promote rapid growth non bank finance
promoting pan european private placement market might help would aligning standards covered bonds
but both strategies would face serious legal obstacles
indeed though hill's modest initial agenda certainly would do no harm should pursued quickly possible any substantial measures beyond would confront major roadblocks
example harmonizing insolvency regimes across continent reducing tax incentives favor debt over equity while entirely logical strike heart member states remaining sovereignty thus will extremely difficult push forward
some other ideas hill floated such relaxing capital standards long term investments run counter eu solvency standards insurers pension funds will implemented next year
some old nags also been dragged out stables another run around course
streamlined prospectuses exemptions some accounting standards small companies been tried before individual countries failed
looser standards issuers weaken protection investors there evidence lax regulation new issues may reduce investor demand them raising cost finance
unless political mood changes radically europe unlikely development would unrealistic expect capital markets union anywhere near transformational banking union been
will best small disturbance few national sacred cows slaughtered
what began slogan may turn out helpful
but capital markets union highly unlikely end europe's love affair its banks
biggest impact market structure will continue come ever rising capital requirements will make bank credit more expensive encourage borrowers look elsewhere
europe dog nighttime
brussels new european commission headed jean claude juncker off rocky start
but would know reading news headlines
sherlock holmes understood dog does bark nighttime usually goes unnoticed
europe case european union fiscal rules issue commission principle eu watchdog should bark loudly when they flouted
last month howls seemed inevitable after two large eu countries italy france submitted budget plans 2015 clearly violated their governments vows continued austerity
first commission dutifully rejected two budgets incompatible rules eu stability growth pact sgp
but something happened was curious arthur conan doyle story
within days both countries offered mini adjustments their budgets worth about 0.2 gdp their finance ministers wrote commission their budgets should now approved
commission did react leaving french italian leaders claim they brussels bureaucrats had last word
fact latest forecast reflects even worse outcome france italy year than originally promised france deficit set increase slightly 2015 italy cyclically adjusted deficit expected deteriorate
stability growth pact prescribes annual improvement least 0.5 gdp
new commission thus risks losing its authority very start its mandate
whether does crucial question because maintaining high degree credibility essential economic policymaking eurozone
see why worth recalling sgp original rules were judged stupid former commission president romano prodi because single minded pursuit deficit below gdp could inappropriate during recessions
argument was accepted sgp was supposedly rendered more intelligent example permitting budget deficits adjusted economic cycle adding medium term objectives expenditure introducing escape clauses
but new rules obviously require strong institution interpret them whose judgment accepted everybody
though checking whether budget below sgp ceiling gdp may straightforward matter there reasonable disagreement about whether business cycle adjustment should estimated 0.5 0.8 gdp whether country adhering its medium term expenditure objective
commission supposed last word thereby ensuring rules credibility consistency seems lost fight first round
could course argue sgp should scrapped because austerity makes no sense when eurozone faces risk deflation
but commission fiscally louche member countries should decide
other problem europe dog does bark but no reason
case united kingdom been asked pay additional contribution eu budget about €2 billion 2.5 billion amounts rounding error uk own budget
reason additional levy few weeks ago uk office national statistics announced proudly had discovered country gross national income gni had been much higher than previously assumed only 2013 but also previous years
including revisions 2002 2012 period difference comes about £350 billion 560 billion
because every eu member state obliged contribute about its gni union budget uk data revision had lead back payment billions euros
but british prime minister david cameron government declared does intend pay money european commission was expecting does need
these two cases dog should barked but did dog barked no reason threaten eu fundamental workings based clear rulebook enforced vigorously strong commission
juncker commission risks losing its authority start rules bent broken accommodate larger member states domestic political priorities
commission must regain political intellectual leadership make its choice either explain why sgp rules must followed even now face deflation agree those who argue current environment calls fiscal stimulus
cannot avoid taking sides insisting publicly austerity rules but acquiescing when member states break them
leaders member states play their part well
pandering populists may attractive terms short term electoral gains but long term cost terms credibility both their own eu will very high

europe asia arms race
when european unification was launched was thought ever closer union would establish community would protect europeans political blackmail
now see though lifting union arms embargo may now delayed thanks us pressure chinese aggressiveness european union become merely tool corruption when france china draw up joint action plans
strategy simple ruthless
world largest dictatorship preparing crush occupy first chinese democracy history taiwan
order do so people republic needs much more sophisticated arms than those possesses today
united states naturally does export such arms china
instead us trying deter china rulers launching military attack democrats taiwan
but eu ever begins offer china extensive exports powerful offensive weapons systems military power people liberation army would able defeat taiwan defense forces
over 600 missiles already deployed mainland aimed cities military bases island
threat more apparent than real now
russia currently sells certain arms china but avoids exporting its most sophisticated systems since kremlin views china potential future threat
however eu countries start competing share chinese market russians could soon tempted sell their best arms communist regime beijing
china new armaments together north korean crisis will probably force half dozen countries region renew their armed forces
thus whenever union should decide lift its ban weapons exports china eu could help fuel arms race east asia
how did china france manage fool eu into thinking should ever take part
when jacques chirac government decided expound its economic co operation china arms became important component strategy
just ruthless prime minister chirac sold nuclear reactor saddam hussein 1970 so president chirac today being lured into doing big business another aggressive dictatorship
rest question economic blackmail
french diplomats course informed china about reluctance other european countries about lifting arms embargo was imposed after massacre tiananmen square 1989
china simply threatened abandon never conclude trade deals these eu members
germans chinese probably murmur something about siemens volkswagen
dutch their whispers most likely about philips
china follows power game within eu through its french friends therefore knows governments need whipped into line
sweden probably been enough whisper ericsson volvo make primer minister göran persson understand what stake his country commercially
what european nation indeed dares put risk chinese order several billion euros
typically enough no eu country mentioned taiwan reason resume arms exports
instead eu talks code conduct probably does mean very much but sounds nice free trade another charming euphemism arms exports dictatorships
silence gives hideous signal
what eu practice says china taiwan cause our own
when union lifts embargo europe will refusing take responsibility catastrophe may approaching

over past ten years held scandinavian conferences taiwan parliaments copenhagen oslo stockholm
but call prime minister persson was enough render conservative party leader fredrik reinfeldt docile
persson had discovered he lacked majority swedish parliament lift arms embargo china
whispering ericsson into reinfeldt ear seems persson achieved desired result
reinfeldt became first conservative party leader swedish history encourage arms exports communist dictatorship
but reinfeldt like jacques chirac forgotten something

they may prefer clear choice
european defense integration now
madrid during european union recent bratislava summit first take place without british presence several proposals improve european security were made
though some may argue otherwise discussions improved european security both wise necessary after period paralysis self doubt european project eu must face its security problems propose unifying initiatives
europe citizens increasingly regard security high priority issue want eu show greater leadership
eu friends allies expect improvement european security well
offering eu citizens security within union borders requires more stability abroad
recent events shown clearly refugee crisis bedeviling eu example would much easier manage situation syria was different
because security home abroad so interrelated eu should compartmentalize its policies idea well developed proposed new global strategy union presented recently high representative federica mogherini
traditionally nation states defended themselves against foreign threats through military means while running their internal affairs according set norms designed protect their citizens rights
today military preparedness still necessary defend against external threats but no longer sufficient
civilian angle needed well
assets needed achieve security must adapt reality today threats conflicts
means eu military capacities cannot structured isolation but must work side side its civil capabilities police agencies intelligence units courts even non governmental organizations
capacity fused civil military response crisis must become integral eu policy its member states
eu already undertaken deployments combine military civilian capabilities
but always been clear much more needed improve efficacy such actions
indeed eu treaty lisbon includes many measures along these lines but most yet been implemented
reason distraction caused eu economic problems since 2008
but now gravity refugee problem requires humanitarian security issues framed within pan european outlook
division between domestic external capacities eu member states simply no longer sustainable
fortunately many capacities available member states their internal policies also useful their defense deployments
example increasingly clear enhancing intelligence cooperation essential
eu wants extend reach its security policies will need more resources but above existing capacities need used better more cooperatively
but such cooperation requires strategic headquarters eu security related operations rather than maintaining current model whereby operational centers established ad hoc basis
moreover order eu achieve strategic autonomy needs competitive european defense industry investment research development defense technologies rising substantially part common effort
european defense agency capabilities development plan was designed precisely these requirements mind
advancing plan will enable optimized use existing member state resources thereby securing advantageous economic synergies well precise identification additional resources required achieve our goals
legal basis mechanism permanent structured cooperation security already exists enshrined treaty lisbon
treaty provisions enable willing eu states reinforce their military cooperation deploy quickly shared missions abroad
activating mechanism been part recent discussions within european council seems most viable way deepen defense integration
eu security defense its pillars would boost europe global weight
some still think deeper defense integration may weaken other institutions such nato eu members belong
but truth europe ability provide effective collective response crisis would welcomed nato would more resources its disposal united nations
integrating eu defense moreover would facilitate nato operations so groups eu countries engaged permanent structured cooperation could example participate north atlantic council nato governing authority single entity
eu defined only how protects its own citizens but also what actions takes outside its borders
beyond ensuring these actions guided international law eu should foster global debate deficiencies certain international norms face today new conflicts
even era pervasive euroskepticism europe citizens want more decisive eu approach foreign security policy necessary beneficial part our duty
eu after will defined its actions peace security among public goods must provide both within beyond its borders
european discrimination trial
what good europe treaties aimed ensuring legal equality citizens when entire groups face systematic discrimination
question european court human rights echr faces week its grand chamber consisting 17 judges begins considering appeal initial ruling rejected claims discrimination against roma czech republic education authorities
european states members council europe signed european convention human rights 39 46 member states adopted framework convention protection national minorities 14 ratified protocol prohibition against discrimination
nevertheless living conditions many roma remain appalling
although recent reports published european union monitoring center racism xenophobia council europe human rights commissioner note some improvements they indicate roma living conditions stagnated deteriorated
roma still victims discrimination access housing employment healthcare education despite significant local efforts council europe instigation its support
discrimination educational access particularly important given its profound effect its victims life prospects
most extreme cases education system itself segregated isolated schools remote camps special classes roma children mainstream schools over representation roma children classes children learning difficulties
ehcr was confronted third issue case d.h others vs czech republic
court was referred 18 cases girls boys who between 1996 1999 were placed special schools children learning difficulties either directly after period time primary schools
question was whether children were victims discrimination owing their national minority status
czech government admitted some special schools student bodies comprised 80 90 roma children
however there was discrimination was direct because under czech law such move could decided only school headmaster based results intelligence test educational psychology counseling centre subject approval child parents legal guardian
difference treatment discriminatory itself
according case law national supreme courts echr discrimination exists only when people similar situation treated differently
yet national international case law recognizes non discriminatory measure theory discriminatory practice
so current case alleged discrimination does stem law itself but its effects plaintiffs relying mainly statistics showing over representation roma special schools
many other reports situation roma czech republic including council europe available
but court rightly noted should rule only cases referred should make known its opinion czech education system legitimacy choices concerning educational opportunities fall under jurisdiction states therefore vary accordingly
working assumption given case had solve ehcr panel seven judges ruled against plaintiffs february concluding law special schools aimed specifically roma does apply only them
according court law legitimate purpose adapt teaching difficulties specific category pupils psychological tests seem objective enough suspected racial bias
moreover requirement parents approval placing children special schools remains valid while roma children who were initially placed those schools could returned mainstream schools later thus reintegrated into normal schooling
well founded court reasoning may feeling unease persists
statistics showing enormous proportion roma children those schools hard ignore suspicion discrimination difficult avoid
while laws changed mentalities do always follow same pace intuitively know easy get psychology mean lot things
indeed before announcing its decision court felt necessary state while did conclude convention had been violated statistics still revealed worrying figures situation general czech republic regarding roma children education needs improved
court president jean paul costa expressed similar view without questioning legitimacy decision although judge cabral barreto wrote dissenting opinion
moreover significant court agreed request parties refer case appeal its grand chamber
according costa rejecting ruling february would contradict previous case law
will court decide workings czech education system itself
will follow judge barreto who calls recognition obligation adopt affirmative action policies aimed benefiting romanies
whatever formula adopted certain roma children should afforded same opportunities other children
imperative underlies importance coming decision provides occasion court reassert fundamental principle non discrimination defines our democratic societies
birth fiscal unions
princeton fiscal unification often effective way enhance creditworthiness may also create new sense solidarity among diverse peoples living within large geographic area
reason europeans often looked toward model united states
but they never been able emulate because their motivations union been so varied
desperate countries often consider such unions best way out emergency
1940 charles de gaulle proposed winston churchill accepted idea franco british union face nazi challenge had already overwhelmed france
1950 five years after war germany first postwar chancellor konrad adenauer also proposed union time between france germany way out his defeated country existential crisis
political unification was rejected but economic association had brilliant career more than six decades until now
fundamental idea behind fiscal union poorer less creditworthy countries gain joint debt liability richer countries
indeed most fascinating proposals effect came beginning world war i when russian empire found its limited capacity borrow international capital markets its low foreign currency reserves left unable create effective military force
so russian government proposed what would amounted full fiscal union britain france war related finances
france latched onto idea because its borrowing capacity was also weaker than britain
british wanted win war but so much they were prepared accept unlimited liability debt incurred french russian governments
reality fiscal union between such diverse political systems would been unworkable
autocratic corrupt regime strong incentive spend way benefits elite
incentive increases command resources more democratically governed state where citizens agree pay taxes pay off future debt because they also control government
only circumstance democracies sign up such deal when clear security interest stake
was predicament gave pre 1914 russia unique access french financial market
yet 1915 british even face ongoing war were unwilling assume russia liabilities
perhaps sheer degree uncertainty pre war europe more amorphous nature threat made security concerns trump financial risk
russia world war i credit arrangements anticipated some political maneuvering about debt its relation security occurred late twentieth century europe
post 1945 west germany was vulnerable long time because sat cold war fault line
result west german governments offered neighboring countries financial help exchange security political solidarity especially moments when they were uncertain about reliability continuity us support
but there were limits
1979 when west germany adopted fixed exchange rate regime support mechanism its partners european monetary system bundesbank ensured was committed unlimited currency interventions might stop when stability deutsche mark was endangered
logic was repeated even larger scale beginning 1990 but time without any pre determined limits
european union commitment monetary union enabled eurozone mediterranean countries improve their debt dynamics public finances dramatically
their borrowing costs fell they locked their currencies into union countries germany particular stronger reputation stability
point problem how divide eventual bill when things became costly was addressed problem excessive debt was wished away establishment convergence criteria were fully implemented anyway
but since 2009 when financial distress eurozone periphery brought such problems fore europeans faced same question wwi allies
security political interests so overwhelming they justify assuming large unlimited liabilities incurred political systems over they no control
because europe peace no singular overriding security threat likely when extent bargain becomes clear voters politicians rich creditor countries will reject
but more uncertain security challenges europe faces may just demand kind strong fiscal link french russians were willing forge before 1914 germans french embraced 1950
implications present important only palatable way necessary balance between liability security achieved through process political reform dissolves corrupt oligarchies weakens incentives fiscal imprudence
approach might ask citizens european countries whether they prepared accept some sort fiscal compact involving hard limit debt
germans refer solution schuldenbremse debt brake
presupposes profound process through institutions assumptions underlying them come widely shared
but takes time history us world most successful union born emergency amply demonstrates
europe global food crisis
paris world been shaken unprecedented spikes food prices hunger riots social tensions demonstrate food supplies returned source insecurity global warming declining natural resources adding unprecedented urgency
2050 estimated there will nine billion people earth so need food may double primarily among urban populations world poorest countries
but there more finding solution than simply identifying those nations capable feeding rest world
increasingly urgent every nation gain means feeding itself
means agriculture should become international priority poorest countries helped safeguard security independence their food supplies
countries organizations already mobilizing
united nations food agriculture organization argues rising food prices could lead increasing global conflicts
davos world economic forum ranks food insecurity major risk humanity
world bank forcefully emphasized importance agriculture jump starting economic expansion breaking cycle poverty
un secretary ban ki moon created working group define common plan action france president nicolas sarkozy proposed global partnership food
sarkozy proposed partnership three pillars
first international group should draft worldwide strategy food security
second international scientific platform should charged evaluating world agricultural situation sending out warnings upcoming crises possibly facilitating governments adoption political other strategic tools deal food crises
finally international finance community despite its current problems must mobilized
reliability size european union farm output means should play role regulator global markets
europe cut back its agricultural production increase its own food imports would contribute significantly worldwide increase food prices
makes imperative eu food production levels held steady sake europeans people world poorest countries
but europe cannot build up its own agriculture detriment less fortunate
so eu must harmonize its policies poorer countries
present export subsidies support payments represent less than european agricultural budget eu undertaken eliminate them once receives reciprocal undertakings major food exporting countries
since 2001 everything but arms initiative products poor countries exception weapons munitions enter eu single market duty free basis
led eu becoming primary market poorest countries products
eu also developing ways respond new global challenges through changes its common agricultural policy
was reflected decision suspend set aside rule requires proportion agricultural land lie fallow
now eu preparing increase dairy quotas progressively evaluating impact world markets its decisions regarding bio fuels
but europe focus must encouraging development local agriculture
doing so only way achieve greater global food security reduce poverty
will also make possible ensure today high prices agricultural products transformed into opportunity poor farmers
vital because according world bank growth farming eliminates poverty twice much growth any other economic sector
indeed agriculture remains primary productive sector world poorest countries employing 65 working population average contributing more than 25 gdp
but over past years support agricultural development been declining
only public development assistance now earmarked agriculture
european commission eu member states therefore planning increase their assistance both through european development fund developing new sources financial support
further liberalization farm trade will ensure food security
faced erratic nature agricultural markets regulation needed soften impact poorer countries volatile food prices
does mean protectionism way forward only taking account specific issues affect international farm trade weather price volatility health risks may necessary time time
but world where productivity differentials great 1,000 would unwise rely markets alone enable poorest countries expand their economies
nor likely much economic expansion will result competition between multinational food distributors producers countries where famine still stalks land
instead bringing together outside expertise local knowledge geography environmental economic constraints order spread risks share management resources projects far more likely help poor countries achieve food independence
was such approach less than years helped postwar europe achieve food sovereignty
countries protected their agricultural development threats posed international markets such india vietnam achieved substantial reductions agricultural poverty
time also come prioritize agriculture order ensure growth more human face
heart eu france wants play its part collective effort fast becoming major issue us
crisis transformation
ankara become cliché characterize our era multiple rapid transformations
but 2012 was particularly eventful single day passed without requiring continuous concerted attention economic crises political military conflicts social upheavals cultural clashes environmental problems some corner world
turkey immediate neighborhood occupied top spot global policy agenda 2012 will continue so 2013
our north europe crossroads undergoing process creative destruction potentially far reaching ramifications well beyond confines european union
our south irreversible quest dignity freedom democracy peace altering region political landscape
needless say economic measures alone cannot end eu ongoing crisis
europe must redefine itself identify its mission anew wishes retain its geopolitical weight
eu must decide whether represents community values narrowly defined geographic entity whose exclusionary impulses will eventually erode its global relevance
integral part europe eu membership strategic objective turkey indifferent bystander contrary strive participate current debate offering our own views ideas
believe example eu integration needs wider well deeper thereby maintaining its positive transformative influence neighboring regions
here course middle east north africa should paramount concern
historically whatever happens side mediterranean had direct impact other given today high level global interdependence there every reason believe will remain true
arab peoples genuine aspiration secure themselves universal rights europeans enjoy refutes west long held orientalist perspective
course still too early predict outcome arab awakening countries transition still face daunting challenges
but none various nightmare scenarios materialized augurs hope future
moreover tunisia libya egypt free fair elections 160;the first these countries history were held 2012
but democracy only about elections task creating essential democratic institutions rule law habits accountability gender equality freedom expression faith still awaits these countries
yet arab peoples finally experienced genuine empowerment crossed threshold fear
i believe they will continue advance toward democracy
said situation syria recent israeli aggression gaza remain open wounds
syria bloody civil war laying waste some world most magnificent ancient cities
syrian people demands same those heard tunisia libya egypt dignified democratic life
instead they gotten inhuman campaign violence including attacks warplanes helicopters tanks president bashar al assad regime
regime effort turn its struggle survival into ethnic sectarian conflict could wreak havoc across region starting neighbors like lebanon iraq
very outset arab awakening turkey taken principled stand side legitimate democratic aspirations
aware our special role historical partner more so source inspiration those demanding their rights freedom felt particularly compelled do so
turkey civil war syria created additional challenge form humanitarian crisis
now hosting approximately 200,000 syrians who fled their country growing violence already spent more than 400 million accommodate these desperate people almost no assistance rest world
but will never dissuaded helping our syrian neighbors their most difficult hour given special bonds emanating centuries shared history
two other fundamental inter related security challenges region arab israeli conflict growing danger proliferation weapons mass destruction wmds also must resolved order ensure middle east historic transformation leads security stability prosperity
here recent violence gaza once again demonstrated risk out regional conflict
israel latest operation gaza brought no benefit either tactical strategic
contrary aggression clearly staged domestic political consumption will harm israel long term security
first time hamas proved capable causing disruptions far away tel aviv while israel was forced defend its behavior reputation even its traditional allies including united states
but biggest lesson israel needs comprehend better new strategic environment following arab awakening
imperative adopt more holistic approach both these problems
reference point such effort should parallel implementation 2002 arab peace plan addresses israel security concerns regional disarmament mechanism based united nations security council resolution 687 adopted 1991 enable elimination wmds entire region
i deeply appreciate us president barack obama remarks nuclear non proliferation treaty review conference 2010 he supported idea invited other major actors take initiative disarmament
approach would enable fair lasting resolution palestinian issue profoundly offends people sense justice causes instability extremism while eliminating tensions arising threat perceptions iran other countries region
beyond advanced countries international financial institutions should implement comprehensive economic recovery program arab countries transition similar marshall plan implemented after world war ii
europe international community opportunity help mediterranean region regain prosperity grandeur once had turn middle east into zone peace democracy stability
turkey will play whatever part order realize vision
europe new world order
berlin november 2008 date remember because day history was made
first time g world leading economies came together washington d.c find answer global financial economic crisis
while first meeting resulted nothing more than declarations intent still marks historic turning point
faced gravest financial economic crisis worldwide since 1930 western industrial nations including russia previously dominated world economy no longer capable coming up effective response
moreover hopes mitigating indeed overcoming global economic crisis rest exclusively emerging economic powers first foremost china
result g excludes most important emerging market countries lost its significance good
globalization resulted lasting change distribution power opportunities laying groundwork new world order twenty first century
once current global crisis over nothing will ever same again
west united states europe relative decline while emerging asian latin american powers will among winners
us responded decline its global strength impressive manner election its first african american president barack obama
amidst gravest crises its history america proven itself world its ability reinvent itself
clear even now decision will three long term consequences
first election black president will put rest tragic legacy slavery american civil war
now issues skin color eye shape gender will no longer play deciding role candidate high even highest office
us political system now reflects country demographic changes non white sections population grow fastest
second obama election will lead reorientation us foreign policy medium term
particular transatlantic/european focus american foreign policy was previously matter course will increasingly become thing past
third internal realignment america political cultural perspective will reinforced ongoing global shift wealth power west east
northeastern pacific powers china japan south korea already america most significant creditors far their importance will increase further result financial crisis
foreseeable future greatest opportunities growth lie region both economic geopolitical reasons america will increasingly turn toward pacific region thus downgrading its transatlantic orientation
bad news europe because once global crisis over europeans will simply become less important
unfortunately europe only doing nothing hold off reverse its decline accelerating process through its own behavior
election obama america turned toward future within globalized multipolar world europe other hand rediscovering national action time crisis thus banking past
european constitution failed lisbon reform treaty limbo after irish rejected stronger european economic governance blocked german french disunity
reaction eu member states ongoing self inflicted impasse unambiguous rather than trying reenergize process further political economic integration they primarily acting their own try fill vacuum emerged
certainly coordination between member states exists even successful times but without strong european institutions such singular successes will last
there very real danger europe will simply miss out historic strategic turn towards multipolar world high price
after summit washington should sunk among europeans everywhere even euroskeptics british isles strategic realignment taking place right now
europeans cannot get their heads around fact nineteenth century over global caravan will continue move forward into twenty first century without them
power european energy union
dublin top priorities established european commission president jean claude juncker ahead his election last summer was creation european energy union
he was right do so
done properly more cohesive energy policy could achieve three strategic objectives simultaneously
coordinating research investment encouraging conservation integrating energy markets energy union would help fight climate change provide europe much needed economic stimulus protect continent supply shocks such those caused crises north africa ukraine
course european union's ability act dependent willingness its member states though some continent's leaders championed initiative others proved less enthusiastic
crucial test their collective resolve will whether they willing support key infrastructure projects deliver three objectives
good example such project north sea countries offshore grid initiative proposal would link offshore wind farms new regional grid allow countries balance variable power supplies across borders
idea first advanced 2009 memorandum understanding signed nine eu member states norway enormous potential 2030 north sea winds could provide europe its electricity carbon free
but project go forward urgently needs political mandate
integrated grid imagined large ring connecting norway united kingdom linking across channel france belgium holland before moving germany returning scandinavia
its implementation would allow europe introduce free trade zone renewable energy reducing need storage excess capacity back up variable power supplies
only would grid pay itself once place would reduce cost new wind farms some providing them existing connection energy markets
interconnected energy system would make particular sense uk germany could use hour time difference between them smooth out peaks troughs demand
renewable energy production nature intermittent sheer number fluctuating power sources germany already pushing its existing grid limit
interconnection would also reduce number new onshore transmission lines country needs
german government produced policy paper outlining how more integrated regional market might work
last year uk matched germany's investments clean energy spending some 15.2 billion solar panels wind farms
but britain will need do lot more meet its climate targets
according parliamentary report cost developing such supergrid could very high...but may bring host economic benefits including tens thousands new jobs offshore renewable industry
regional initiative would also allow prime minister david cameron accommodate opposition within his party onshore renewable energy plants
each individual countries involved project would benefit its construction
holland belgium need cost effective way develop their own offshore resources
denmark already benefits interconnected electricity market lesson learned makes sense integrate even further
norway would able sell its hydropower secure backup supply should climate change leave running dry
advances cable technology would allow ireland link france providing alternative route european markets uk elects remain outside network
juncker's €315 billion 360 billion investment plan proposed december includes some €87 billion interconnection projects
would make sense combine these into single initiative common standards technology planning regulations
doing so would lower cost capital loans european investment bank give boost european technology companies
baltic states also planning their own offshore grid
but just northern europe could gain such approach
europe's southeastern mediterranean countries could also benefit sharing power
most necessary legal regulatory framework already place there no need treaty changes complex new legislation
needed political direction so european commission establish necessary governance structures
strength europe's commitment true energy union will revealed when european council meets march 19
among decisions will make will whether build these regional grids
eu its member states reach agreement they could simultaneously boost their economies improve their energy security
they could end up buying technology china united states will investing their own grids coming years
europe energy essentials
madrid last month european council meeting brussels energy issues dominated agenda third time year
energy emergence focal point european leaders makes sense given lies confluence three existential threats facing european union revisionist russia declining competitiveness european businesses climate change
these developments challenge europe values its social model viability world long term security eu leaders must focus building new energy system ensures reliable supply sensible pricing ecological sustainability
good news framework already emerging could facilitate initiative
indeed beyond widely discussed targets energy production 2030 covering greenhouse gas emissions energy efficiency renewable resources european council conclusions embrace key elements practical effective approach energy
but order move aspiration implementation europeans must muster unity purpose so far been conspicuously absent eu energy policy
most tangible element eu emerging energy policy framework internal energy market once completed will allow unimpeded flow energy related investments throughout eu
such integrated energy market would lead significant savings estimates go high €40 billion 51 billion annually 2030 thereby providing much needed competitiveness boost
internal energy market would enhance europe energy security well
though eu whole maintains balanced energy mix supply divided relatively evenly among gas coal oil renewables nuclear generation individual countries often excessively dependent single source more dangerously single supplier russia
unrestricted energy flows within eu would mitigate risks supply disruptions shocks
course establishing internal energy market just matter policy
eu needs right infrastructure facilitate movement energy among states regions
front there much done
spain example currently transmit only 1.5 its electricity generating capacity rest europe owing lack transmission infrastructure pyrenees france reluctance open its energy market competition iberian peninsula
european council recognizing urgency issue called greater electricity interconnection targeting generating capacity 2020 2030 countries exporting megawatts power every 100 megawatts they produce
achieving these benchmarks will require both significant capital investment shift eu member states mentalities so fears like france do continue impede progress
countries need know their companies will suffer either outflows electricity other eu countries during shortages price increases owing rising emphasis renewables
emerging european energy union council endorsed could ideal vehicle facilitate shift
problem eu leaders yet define compelling effective strategy building
indeed though european commission president jean claude juncker established vice presidential post responsible energy union now held maroš šefčovič no seems know what exactly position will entail
so far šefčovič merely presented five vague pillars energy union leading many consider current policy approach energy union hollow
eu needs well defined energy strategy helps overcome trust deficit hampering effective solutions
means first foremost establishing clear predictable community rules cost sensitive policies energy union
doing so would help eu achieve another critical goal presenting more united front rest world
council recent conclusions recognize imperative new commission structure conducive policy coherence
member states must now fall into line
major test will next year united nations climate change conference cop21 paris
2009 conference copenhagen was unmitigated disaster europe lead example approach failed attract followers
eu cannot afford isolate itself misunderstand geopolitical forces play yet again
fortunately council seems internalized lesson leaving open possibility reconsidering its commitments after cop21
but lot do before only establish unified approach but also translate approach into strong tactics clear message cop21
success would provide strong foundation broader eu energy agenda
eu address key challenges energy security competitive pricing sustainability will need unified comprehensive compelling policy approach
foundations such approach internal energy market framework energy union cohesive external voice emerging
now europe needs follow through make work
europe engine peace
critics european monetary integration often point out absence political union monetary union doomed fail
i agree critics conclusion but their premise success single currency so far been due precisely political commitments union member countries
other words true european union does constitute political union
european economic integration its aspects reflects desire integrate europe politically least my view implies european economic monetary integration irreversible
been true outset european integration process 1952 when six countries established european coal steel community ecsc
aim ecsc was explicitly political remove control two most important raw materials production heavy weaponry states had just fought bloodiest war history
drive peace remained quietly key motivation behind further steps toward europe economic integration was regarded vehicle achieving political integration
1951 french prime minister rene pléven proposed establishing european defense community edc alongside ecsc
he failed but idea did vanish
later year robert schumann french foreign minister time founding father european integration explicitly identified ecsc drive peace
he described means creating fusion interests…that will leavening may grow wider deeper community between countries long opposed another bloody conflicts
these words were echoed eve introduction single currency
particular germany under chancellor helmut kohl often linked monetary integration objective political union
kohl once referred single currency success matter war peace
reason i do agree those who argue germany support european monetary integration was price paid europe acceptance german reunification
contrary historical record shows germany made case parallel drive monetary political integration well before fall iron curtain
course there other motives behind support economic integration
eu leaders convinced achieving so called four freedoms i.e freedom movement goods services capital people will optimize well being europe population
they also aspire increase continent strategic power
but peace was principal driving force minds people like schumann jean monnet beginning european integration process was helmut schmidt valéry giscard d’estaing when they laid foundations single currency today european central bank
half century process european integration proceeded sometimes setbacks sometimes giant steps forward joining formerly separate markets creating very close trade relations
over time stimulated ever greater economic convergence
course europe economies become look alikes nor gdp per capita been fully equalized
but differences between europe economies were never so dramatic form insurmountable barrier embarking upon most ambitious project adopting common currency
understanding history vital because europe union once again stands threshold should keep its promise start membership talks turkey
wake defeat eu constitutional treaty france netherlands spring many say europe decade old promise cannot should kept
what strikes me dangerous issue peace motor driven european integration start rarely comes up debate about what do wake these events
contrary responsible statesmen party leaders come out openly against turkish membership
i would hoped these people had learned schumann monnet what really matters europe its future sadly does seem case
course i do fear some sort military clash between turkey eu
after turkey been remains loyal member nato
but increasingly virulent violent clash cultures emerging europe particularly france germany spain netherlands between islam humanitarian christian jewish traditions
me europe integration muslim turkey into its political union same sort question peace schumann monnet successfully confronted
today europe needs peace between cultures much once needed peace between nations reason must welcome turkey into our midst
eu bold new strategy
brussels when problems accumulate europe where failed coup turkey comes hard heels united kingdom decision leave european union attention often focused most recent issue arise
earlier problems now seeming less urgent neglected
many years europeans seen how plays out end none problems ever seems resolved
turkish coup appears now resolving itself though no yet knows what long term implications will vital country
brexit without doubt veritable blow european project
member state regrettably chosen move ahead alone but mustn’t lead eu into most damaging situation paralysis
many issues union must still resolve won’t disappear merely passage time
most urgent europe security each day passes without taking joint action opportunity lost leads greater risk
addressing such issues effectively rather than falling into trap immediate requires adhering accepted strategies
identifying challenges establishing long term objectives designing collective action achieve those objectives strategies provide framework initiatives address problems more far sighted coherent way
mind federica mogherini eu high representative foreign affairs her team designed presented global strategy european security clearly defined aims befitting conditions both within beyond our borders
many observers indicated now best time elaborate vision assumes europeans united common interests
but strategy clearly declares cooperation no longer question principle existential imperative
why i disagree those who call global strategy ill timed even useless
even though was presented european council week after brexit referendum its aim implement provisions foreseen treaty lisbon seven years after treaty entered into effect
also result june 2015 mandate european council itself
aims develop policy strengthen eu many citizens want
remain immobile would been grave error
global strategy defines clear objectives considers mistakes past deeply anchored eu present day reality
calls more responsible united credible eu only response capable overcoming euroskepticism
defines actions europe must take capacities must its own defense security
takes into account long term effects its actions understands development eu member states essential conflict prevention
recognizes only greater unity will enable europe confront challenges terrorism migration climate change
fundamental fact should borne mind when assessing global strategy usefulness threats europe security common because some treaty intergovernmental consensus said so
they common because neighbors because like world around us irremediably global
consequence document like global strategy creation common discourse
2003 europeans also needed unite behind common foreign policy following differences created intervention iraq
but problem today very different level european project itself being questioned
revealing eu capacity act effectively would help confirm necessity its existence
global strategy useful here
european citizens perceive terrorism refugee tragedy questions vital importance want eu play greater role addressing them other global issues
pew research center study ten european countries including supposed bastions euroskepticism like uk poland hungary found average 74 those polled supported more decisive action eu abroad
recent years seen how internal external security conditions closely linked
why interest safeguarding internal security global strategy emphasizes need more improved external action
also why eu requires integral approach conflicts crises uses every available instrument policy
moreover manner conduct external action characterizes us europeans
field human security few organizations deploy missions operations complete eu combining military civilian elements such police judges
much changed since european security strategy 2003 europe must now find its place amid competition great powers negotiate conflicts instability its eastern southern flanks
there been important changes within europe well opposition strengthening eu seems rise evidenced brexit vote position recently expressed visegrad group czech republic hungary poland slovakia
presentation global strategy those favor moving european project forward placed initiative table
without only proposals less europe would been heard
over coming months must move our foreign security policy forward order implement strategy objectives
those us who favor continuing advance cannot remain silent
europeanizing europe
berlin eurozone center global financial crisis because only there realm second most important currency after dollar does crisis hit weak structure rather than state real power
structure squandering trust citizens markets its ability resolve conflicts while pushing international financial system brink disaster
other words financial crisis now reflects political crisis eurozone calls into question very existence european project whole
europe monetary union fails much common market european institutions treaties will left
would write off six decades successful european integration unknown consequences
failure would coincide emergence new world order two centuries western predominance come end
power wealth shifting towards east asian other emerging countries while america will preoccupied its own problems turning atlantic towards pacific
europeans don’t address their interests now no will do them
europe today does become agent its own destiny will become object new world powers
cause european crisis three decades neo liberalism nor result collapse speculation fueled asset bubble violation maastricht criteria ballooning debt greedy banks
important these factors europe problem what happened but what did happen creation common european government
beginning 1990 when majority european union member states decided form monetary union common currency central bank idea central government lacked support
result phase monetary union construction was postponed leaving impressive edifice lacked strong foundation ensure stability times crisis
monetary sovereignty was made common cause but power needed exercise remained national capitals
was believed time formalized rules imposing mandatory limits deficits debt inflation would enough
but foundation rules turned out illusion principles always need support power otherwise they cannot stand test reality
eurozone confederation sovereign states common currency common principles mechanisms now failing test
unable respond decisively crisis eurozone losing confidence any currency most important asset
unless political power europe europeanized current confederation evolving into federation eurozone eu whole will disintegrate
political economic financial costs renationalization would enormous eu collapse feared around world good reason
contrast currency union political deficit addressed now first establishing fiscal union a common budget common liabilities real political federation will possible
let us clear anything less than united states europe will powerful enough prevent looming disaster
like eurozone will act eu avant garde because eu whole its 27 member states will neither willing nor able accelerate political unification
unfortunately unanimous support necessary eu treaty changes simply could secured
so what should done
europeans made decisive progress integration outside scope eu treaties but very much european spirit when they agreed open their borders so called schengen agreement today part eu treaties
drawing successful experience eurozone should avoid eu original sin creating supra national structure lacked democratic legitimization
eurozone needs government things stand moment consist only respective heads state government development already started
because there no fiscal union without common budget policy nothing decided without national parliaments
means european chamber comprising national parliaments leaders indispensable
initially such chamber could advisory body national parliaments maintaining their competencies later basis intergovernmental treaty must become real parliamentary control decision making body made up national parliaments delegated members
course because treaty kind would mean extensive transfer sovereignty european intergovernmental institutions would need direct popular legitimization through referendums member states including especially germany
none addresses important questions such common policies ensure economic stability promote growth
but learned anything current crisis such issues cannot even framed unless until eurozone reliable institutional framework sturdy foundation consisting real government effective parliamentary control genuine democratic legitimization
europe war
new york invading ukraine 2014 president vladimir putin russia posed fundamental challenge values principles european union was founded rules based system kept peace europe since 1945
neither europe leaders nor its citizens fully aware scope challenge much less how deal
putin regime based rule force manifested repression home aggression abroad
but been able gain tactical advantage least short term over eu united states determined avoid direct military confrontation
violating its treaty obligations russia annexed crimea established separatist enclaves eastern ukraine donbas region
when appeared last summer ukrainian government might win war donbas putin ordered invasion regular russian armed forces
preparations second wave military action began november when putin provided separatists new influx armored columns personnel
west sadly provided embattled ukraine only façade support
equally disturbing been continuing reluctance international leaders provide new financial commitments ukraine despite growing pressure its foreign currency reserves specter full blown financial meltdown
result mere threat military action may sufficient bring about ukraine economic collapse
putin seems holding out prospect grand bargain russia helping fight against islamic state example supplying s300 missiles syria thus preserving us air domination exchange us giving russia control over its so called near abroad
should us president barack obama accept such deal entire structure international relations would dangerously altered favor use force
would tragic mistake far reaching geopolitical consequences
collapse ukraine would tremendous loss nato indirectly eu us
victorious russia would pose potent threat baltic states their large ethnic russian populations
instead supporting ukraine nato would defend itself its own soil exposing both eu us danger they been so eager avoid direct military confrontation russia
threat eu political cohesion even greater than military risk
euro crisis transformed ever closer union equal sovereign states willingly sacrificing share their independence common good into association creditor debtor countries debtors struggling meet creditors terms
new eu neither equal nor voluntary
fact many young people debtor countries eu seems like foreign oppressor
about recently elected european parliament ran anti european platforms
internal weakness allowed putin russia its own far attractive emerge potent rival eu
hungarian prime minister viktor orbán gone so far cite putin his role model he no anomaly
neither europe leaders nor its citizens seem recognize russia attack ukraine indirectly assault eu its principles governance
should clear inappropriate country association countries war pursue fiscal austerity eu continues do
available resources should put work war effort even requires running up budget deficits
europe fortunate german chancellor angela merkel behaved true european regard threat posed russia
foremost advocate sanctions she been more willing defy german public opinion business interests issue than any other
but germany also been main advocate fiscal austerity merkel needs understand contradiction between these positions
sanctions against russia necessary but they without repercussions
european economies including germany suffering sanctions depressive impact aggravates recessionary deflationary forces already work
contrast helping ukraine defend itself against russian aggression would stimulative effect ukraine europe
eu members war they need start acting like
means modifying their commitment fiscal austerity recognizing they better off helping ukraine defend itself than hoping they will defend eu themselves
ukraine needs immediate cash injection say billion promise more when needed order stave off financial collapse
international monetary fund could provide these funds did previously eu promising match imf contribution
actual expenditures would remain under imf control subject implementation far reaching structural reforms
ukraine there more factor working eu favor country new leadership determined correct previous governments corruption mismanagement abuses
indeed already created detailed strategy cut household gas consumption more than half goal dispersing corrupt gas monopoly naftogaz ending ukraine energy dependence russia
new ukraine resolutely pro european ready defend europe defending itself
but its enemies only putin russia but also its own bureaucracy financial oligarchy formidable cannot defeat them alone
supporting new ukraine 2015 beyond most cost effective investment eu could make
could even help eu recapture spirit unity shared prosperity led its creation
short saving ukraine eu could also save itself
price european indifference
baghdad europe migration debate taken disturbing turn
began creation catch concept a legal freak migrant obscures difference central law between economic political migration between people escaping poverty those driven their homes war
unlike economic migrants those fleeing oppression terror massacre inalienable right asylum entails unconditional obligation international community provide shelter
even when distinction acknowledged often part another sleight hand attempt convince credulous minds men women children who paid thousands dollars travel rickety boats washing up islands lampedusa kos economic migrants
reality however 80 these people refugees attempting escape despotism terror religious extremism countries like syria eritrea afghanistan
why international law requires cases asylum seekers examined bulk but
even when accepted when sheer number people clamoring get europe shores makes but impossible deny barbarity driving them flee third smokescreen goes up
some including russian foreign minister sergei lavrov claim conflicts generating these refugees rage only arab countries being bombed west
here again figures do lie
top source refugees syria where international community refused conduct kinds military operations required responsibility protect even though international law demands intervention when mad despot having killed 240,000 his people undertakes empty his country
jordan population 6.5 million taken nearly 700,000
meanwhile europe display united selfishness scuttled plan relocate mere 40,000 asylum seekers their cities refuge italy greece
second minority who do choose germany france scandinavia united kingdom hungary enemies who come destroy us even sponge off european taxpayers
they applicants freedom lovers our promised land our social model our values
they people who cry out europe
europe way millions europeans arriving century ago ellis island learned sing america beautiful
there ugly rumor imaginary assault been clandestinely orchestrated strategists great replacement foreigners supplanting native europeans worse agents international jihad today migrants tomorrow terrorists bullet trains
should go without saying nonsense
taken together these distortions delusions had serious consequences
starters mediterranean sea been but abandoned human smugglers
mare nostrum gradually becoming kind vast watery mass grave described faraway poet
some 2,350 people drowned already year
but most europeans these people little more than statistics just women men who survived journey remain unidentified indistinguishable threatening anonymous mass
our society spectacle normally so quick manufacture instant celebrity serve face crisis du jour anything swine flu truckers strike taken interest fate single migrants
these individuals whose course europe resembles phoenician princess europa who arrived tyre zeus back several millennia ago being wholly rejected indeed walls being constructed keep them out
result another group people being denied basic rights
such people hannah arendt once observed will ultimately come see commission crime their only path into world law those who enjoy rights law confers
europe harassed its xenophobes consumed self doubt turned its back its values
indeed forgotten what
bell tolls only migrants but also europe whose humanistic patrimony crumbling before our very eyes
europe jihadi generation
madrid ‒ he came algeria seeking better life anticipating escape poverty oppression hopelessness
paris he found low skill job had children grandchildren
french citizens they had right education health care
but they grew up ghettos ring france major cities surrounded families like theirs literally margins society
unable integrate fully they had few opportunities economic advancement
paradise was never gained
story been repeated millions times countries western europe immigrants their families ending up poor excluded
worst case scenario they recruited extremist groups seem offer what they missing sense belonging identity purpose
after lifetime marginalization participation larger cause seem worth lies self destruction even death inclusion demands
wake attack french satirical magazine charlie hebdo paris thwarting another attack belgium europe needs take good look itself
must recognize second third generation immigrants susceptible blandishments terrorist organizations because european citizenship translated into social economic inclusion
anything growing inequality exacerbated years crisis making problem worse
people need hope
they need believe vision project promises better future them their communities
european countries once offered sense hope
but crisis official response replaced hope frustration disillusionment
created fertile ground anti immigrant populists islamist terrorists alike
more than 1,200 french citizens estimated joined jihadi cause syria along 600 united kingdom 550 germany 400 belgium
other european countries including spain experiencing similar phenomenon
some european citizens like charlie hebdo assassins acted home
while intelligence services police forces must engaged prevent attacks devising effective strategy counteract extremist movements requires first foremost understanding what drives them
western countries must go beyond defending freedom speech improving police coordination develop lasting solutions address adherents economic social marginalization while avoiding cultural confrontation reliance repression alone
more fundamentally such solutions require abandoning false dichotomy liberty security
security concerns trump basic rights freedoms fanaticism will scored victory same thing will happen expressions islamophobia xenophobia increase
week after paris attacks german chancellor angela merkel reiterated sentiment expressed former president christian wulff 2010 standing beside turkish prime minister ahmet davutoğlu merkel declared islam much part germany judaism christianity
statement represents right way forward
muslim immigrants whether first second third generation must able integrate fully into european society gaining same opportunities europe other residents citizens
principle should applied global level well through establishment inclusive framework fosters development encourages rejection fanaticism islamic world
aggressive fundamentalism infighting held down christian societies centuries been relegated past where must remain
religion only belief system also institution language even kind market actor competing supporters
radical terrorist groups attempt consolidate their distorted version true islam only institution imposing their language win entire muslim market
today groups like islamic state nigeria boko haram joined al qaeda struggle attract muslims over world thereby securing their leadership global jihad
these groups take advantage unruly environments weak collapsing institutions gain territorial foothold
indeed was failed transitions syria libya yemen after arab spring revolts fueled islamic state emergence
millions young people though disillusioned decades social paralysis unemployment brutal dictatorships had dared expect better
though tunisians made progress other affected populations like many muslim immigrants europe had their hopes shattered
jihad like any other reductionist political program capable seducing wide variety people
attribute they almost always share sense futility lack purpose
west must recognize afghanistan iraq shown conflict arab world cannot resolved through foreign military intervention
only way restore order spur progress region empowering moderate muslims so they triumph over forces radicalism violence
west role identify them offer them acceptance support
lesson should applied both abroad home
europe clash generations
london europe financial crisis goes acute chronic dispute over who will bear costs resolving fueling emergence new generation political movements
so called periphery political upstarts promise citizens alternative austerity
eurozone core countries they purport protect taxpayers relentless demands debtor country relief
how europe leaders respond these new political challengers will determine whether monetary union stabilizes fractures
europe political elite most part been strongly integrationist
given they largely post world war ii generation they acutely aware benefits peaceful europe
1990 differing visions european integration led problematic compromise
order secure france backing german reunification germany agreed create monetary union but fiscal union
now europe suffering consequences faustian bargain
same time europe leaders under pressure new generation voters who grew up shadow berlin wall collapse
lifting iron curtain gave west access vast supply cheap labor eastern europe
china subsequent emergence expanded supply further culminating china entry into world trade organization 2001
result many europe economies began fall behind
european leaders hoped monetary union would help europe less competitive economies catch up richer countries north
during its first decade euro ostensibly delivered
just cheap mortgage financing papered over cracks growing income inequality united states cheap capital north accelerated europe apparent economic convergence
post wall generation seemed luck least while
but income inequality was worsening steadily member countries more highly educated citizens benefiting booming services industry while less educated suffered manufacturing moved cheaper locations
global financial crisis struck income inequality rose sharply post wall generation southern europe suffered largest drop living standards since wwii
unlike us was founded political cause opposition british colonialism forged common national identity countries joining european union sought simply avoid further warfare continent
while laudable cause was inadequate foster shared european identity
contrary allowed national identity flourish
post wall generation whose members less than 40 years old thus far removed wwii little appreciation cause
them debtor creditor countries increasingly divergent economic objectives much more meaningful
citizens debtor economies who grew up complacent about economic convergence lost their savings many cases run out hope
meanwhile citizens creditor countries focused protecting gains made before crisis after was their savings financed their neighbors reckless spending
throughout eurozone rising income inequality created underclass increasingly suspicious monetary union
post war generation ages most its members now least 60 years old its leaders either senior leadership positions acting senior statesmen remaining support integration waning
many post wall voters stand margins established parties forming parties their own while more pragmatic group being pulled between old order new movements
muddled reactive response euro crisis reflects compromises traditional political parties made order remain power generational differences become increasingly extreme
political revolutions rarely arise out brief periods acute crisis
rather they follow more generations chronic decline when fear economic loss gives way targeted anger charismatic voices surface orchestrate response
pattern recurred throughout history french revolution way fall berlin wall
although markets may been cowed into submission now cracks eurozone political foundations beginning show
