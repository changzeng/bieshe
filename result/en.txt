but arguments about whether limit should 60 gdp more miss larger point nineteen years experience maastricht treaty created both eu euro shown convincingly such limits unenforceable countries clout flaunt limits will do so whenever politically convenient debt crisis near exceptions will found waivers will issued buyers additional debt will lined up so question what do when debt gets near its limit however high low how prevent debt getting near limit first place except very extreme unusual circumstances need fiscal rules fiscal rule any pre specified mechanism constrains spending deficit according study international monetary fund 80 countries around world use some kind fiscal rule but fiscal rules created equal
too loose rule merely ornamental too tight constitutional amendment requiring balanced budget example rule could create rather than solve problems think economic political chaos would ensue spain unemployment 21 were forced eliminate its huge fiscal deficit overnight sweden chile almost poles apart geographically but both used sophisticated fiscal rules successfully chile sets target its cyclically adjusted fiscal balance balance emerges after accounting deviations commodity prices domestic output their trends when commodity prices boomed middle last decade rule called huge budget surpluses chile achieved repaying almost its public debt accumulating sizable rainy day fund when financial crisis came chile was able mount aggressive fiscal stimulus without so much hiccup financial markets course no fiscal rule account contingencies why need independent fiscal council administer just need independent central bank pursue inflation targeting monetary rule agreeing composition such council europe would hard but no harder than was agree makeup ecb board eurobonds plus fiscal rules formula euro best hope salvation
unfortunately another crisis two might necessary before european leaders consider seriously europe easy money endgame munich euro brought balance payments crisis europe just gold standard did 1920s fact there only difference between two episodes during today crisis huge international rescue packages been available these rescue packages relieved eurozone financial distress but high cost only they enabled investors avoid paying their poor decisions they also given overpriced southern european countries opportunity defer real depreciation form reduction relative prices goods necessary restore competitiveness was destroyed euro initial years when caused excessive inflation indeed countries like greece portugal spain regaining competitiveness would require them lower prices their own products relative rest eurozone about compared beginning crisis italy probably needs reduce its relative prices but portugal italy so far failed deliver any such real depreciation while relative prices greece spain fallen only respectively
revealingly crisis countries only ireland managed turn corner reason obvious its bubble already burst end before any rescue funds were available ireland was its own so had no option but implement massive austerity measures reducing its product prices relative other eurozone countries 13 peak trough today ireland unemployment rate falling dramatically its manufacturing sector booming relative terms greece received most europe bailout money showed largest increase unemployment official loans granted country european central bank international community increased more than sixfold during past five years €53 billion 58 billion february 2010 €324 billion 181 gdp now nevertheless unemployment rate more than doubled 26 there four possible economic policy responses state affairs first europe could become transfer union north giving more more credit south later waiving second south deflate
third north inflate fourth countries no longer competitive exit europe monetary union depreciate their new currency each path associated serious complications first creates permanent dependence transfers sustaining relative prices prevents economy regaining competitiveness second path drives many debtors crisis countries into bankruptcy third expropriates creditor countries north fourth may cause contagion effects via capital markets possibly forcing policymakers introduce capital controls cyprus 2013 european politics focused so far providing public credit crisis countries near zero interest rates eventually may morph into transfers but now ecb attempting break impasse through quantitative easing qe ecb stated goal reflate eurozone thereby reducing euro external value purchasing more than €1.1 trillion worth assets
according ecb president mario draghi inflation rate currently stands just below raised average just below would offer southern european countries way out their competitiveness trap because prices remained unchanged south while northern countries inflated southern countries could gradually reduce their goods relative prices without feeling too much pain course case north needs inflate faster than just say southern europe kept its inflation rate france inflated rate germany would inflate good rest eurozone annually reach eurozone average slightly less than pattern would continue about ten years bring eurozone back into balance point germany price level would about 50 higher than today i do expect qe bring about some inflation given exchange rate relative price currency more euros come into circulation their value fall substantially establish new equilibrium currency market experience similar programs united states united kingdom japan shown qe unleashes powerful forces depreciation qe eurozone will thus bring about inflation draghi wants via higher import export prices
whether effect will sufficient revitalize southern europe remains seen there risk japan china us will sit their hands while euro loses value world possibly even sliding into currency war moreover southern eu countries instead leaving prices unchanged could abandon austerity issue ever greater volume new bonds stimulate economy competitiveness gains rebalancing would fail materialize after initial flash pan eurozone would return permanent crisis euro finally fully discredited would meet very messy end only hope scenario does come pass southern countries stay course austerity their last chance europe america drumbeat war iran america capital once again abuzz talk war only latest strategy victory iraq but now also military action against iran harder becomes discern any rationality bush administration actions louder rumor mill grinds
will bush order air special forces attack iran ever since bush state union address end january hardly day passed without something happening connection iran without bush administration ratcheting up its rhetoric clearly us also pressing ahead preparations air strike a more extensive military commitment scarcely possible given how overstretched us ground forces already indeed confrontation iranians iraq visibly intensifying may gathering strength elsewhere well bomb directed iranian revolutionary guard recently exploded iran border afghanistan there course new attempts united states drum up evidence iranian threat may justify attack bluff world could perhaps calmly wait answer but fact progress iran nuclear program approaching end president bush term might create incalculable dynamic its own iraq america strength may enough start war but win
but consequences military adventure iran would far surpass those war iraq doing things halves yet again middle east would worst possible options bad region bad its neighbors first among neighbors affected would europe so how europe its vital security interests stake responded these developments british prime minister tony blair already adapted us administration new confrontational rhetoric french president jacques chirac unguardedly speculated iran two nuclear bombs might pose serious threat given possibility nuclear retaliation 45;&#45 his musings so startled french officials they quickly jumped correct president comments german chancellor angela merkel gives speeches security conferences find favor america but otherwise germany prefers stay background across europe risk avoidance seems order day even expense common interest nato solidarity german navy defending lebanese coast against hezbollah while other european nations bear brunt policing lebanon ground afghanistan germany its strong military presence north been turning deaf ear calls help canadian allies fighting revived taliban south
germany now wants send some tornado jets reconnaissance purposes better than nothing but much terms security policy europe stagnating regressing very moment when unity needed more ever big three europe germany current eu president particular must find way act together strategic security matters they don’t europe will largely cease matter when going gets rough going now getting quite rough iran persian gulf should iran attacked year consequences will borne first foremost region but also europe middle east immediate western neighbor they will felt long time come indeed europe will share costs iran prevails becomes nuclear power so there much stake old continent precise two overriding eu security interests stake avoiding war iran preventing iran becoming nuclear power these two apparently contradictory interests reconciled translated into common strategy adopting three pronged approach based efficient isolation effective containment direct negotiations
europeans led merkel blair chirac should agree assure us europe ready pay high perhaps very high economic price taking decisive action intensify sanctions against iran but they should offer only two strict preconditions military option taken off table parties involved including us enter into direct negotiations iran policy isolation coupled direct negotiations would strengthened further common strategy toward syria aimed regime change but coalition change drawing syria away its close alliance iran was both right important eu council foreign ministers agreed sanctions against iran faced threat financial sanctions iran political elite increasingly realizing price its confrontational course imperative further process resolute manner while same time rejecting military adventurism up europe prevent two worst developments iran war nuclear armament acting jointly determination vital european transatlantic interests stake thus europe responsibility especially germany current eu president act now europe under siege
brussels many europeans feel like their countries under assault huge numbers migrants flow across their borders whether they being exposed refugees firsthand just seeing images them splashed across newspaper pages europeans well aware vast numbers desperate people trying enter european union territory any means possible but awareness yet translate into unified response tensions among member states seem rising perhaps because problem differs so greatly across countries per capita basis sweden receives times more asylum applications than united kingdom where official policy toward refugees remains most hostile germany now become main destination overall receiving nearly 40 eu total even per capita basis several times more than eu average course there clear rules about how responsibility refugees delineated according so called dublin regulation first eu member state into refugee crosses responsible person asylum application but clearly problematic puts entire burden refugees eu frontier countries though may been huge problem 1990s when eu countries received only 300,000 asylum applications annually cannot work year when total expected triple number smaller border countries like hungary greece simply do capacity register house hundreds thousands asylum seekers
larger countries like italy incentive overlook large numbers refugees landing their shores knowing nothing done those refugees will likely head elsewhere mainly northern europe germany recognizing dublin system untenable now decided process asylum applications syrians regardless where they crossed into eu decision was likely driven least partly how difficult given eu porous internal borders determine where refugee first entered 2013 ruling european court justice germany could return iranian refugee greece where applicant was found face real risk being subjected inhuman degrading treatment probably heightened germany sense responsibility issue germany largest eu member country terms population gdp so some extent does make sense take lead but germany still accounts less than fifth eu population less than quarter its economy other words even germany handle europe refugees today few months ago european commission tried its hand resolving problem courageous proposal distribute refugees across member states according simple equation accounts population gdp but plan was rejected member states particularly those fewest refugees claiming represented undue interference domestic affairs put eu its usual quandary everybody recognizes there problem but solution requires unanimity cannot achieved because each country defends only its own interests
only way forward leave out countries most averse accepting immigrants least temporarily create solution involving just those willing share burden may seem fair but more refugees landing europe borders every day eu leaders cannot afford delay action but there another dimension crisis makes addressing more complicated migrants conflict areas like syria thus do according international law right asylum there also plenty economic migrants say poorer parts balkans hoping escape poverty home willing misuse asylum system process lodging application even without any chance being accepted appealing because until rejected applicant receives basic housing social services including health care pocket money amount may well exceed wages his her home country spending few months northern europe while asylum application processed far more attractive than going home job pays barely livable wage no job number asylum seekers increases so does time takes process their applications making system more tempting economic migrants indeed close half asylum seekers germany now come safe countries like serbia albania macedonia europe populists use such cases welfare tourism sow fear anger among european public reaching agreement accommodate actual refugees becomes increasingly difficult
against background eu needs take action two fronts first member countries must urgently boost their capacity deal asylum applications so they quickly identify those who deserve protection second eu needs improve burden sharing ideally among countries but perhaps among smaller group first providing shelter those who gain asylum international law basic morality demands nothing less turning off dividend spigot new york european banks high litigation restructuring costs resulted major losses their books abysmal stock market performance industry european regulators now reflect dismal state affairs search solutions they should consider banks revenue distribution including employee bonuses shareholder dividends part problem revenue distribution primary reason european banks capital shortfalls understand why should look back october 2014 when european banking authority began balance sheet stress tests eurozone largest 123 banks found capital shortfall €25 billion 28 billion them time eba required banks devise plans address their respective shortfalls within months
some banks took action raised equity through rights issues sometimes substantial help governments but most banks mollified regulators simply shedding riskier assets improve their capital ratios needless say these efforts were ineffective european banks share prices declined 50 average since initial 2014 assessment banks failed stress test didn’t take result seriously partly blame but so too regulators who did sufficiently hold banks feet fire improve their balance sheets who may applied stress tests were too weak detect financial frailty eba conducted another series stress tests reported results late july latest round looked 51 banks contrary previous tests was designed identify capital shortfalls but rather provide a common analytical framework consistently compare assess resilience large eu banks adverse economic developments regulators now suppose european banking sector resilient adverse shocks same day eba announcement worst performer italy banca monte dei paschi di siena announced €5 billion 5.6 billion new funding pursuant its €5.6 billion capital requirement still market reaction announcement was negative eurostoxx banks index fell 7.5 two days most likely because eba did include specific estimates european banks capital shortfalls outline recapitalization plan new paper investigating market reaction using united states capital requirement rules calculate total capital shortfall 51 participating banks €123 billion
despite large capital shortfall 28 34 publicly listed banks stress test paid out about €40 billion dividends 2015 meaning they distributed average over 60 their earnings shareholders dividend payments made under capitalized banks amount substantial wealth transfer subordinated bondholders shareholders because bondholders who will suffer losses crisis moreover potentially wealth transfer taxpayers private shareholders because under new banking rules government bailouts possible after bondholders covered bailed bank equity liabilities contrast undercapitalized banks us forced halt forms capital distribution they fail stress test fortunately following 2016 round stress tests eba now also considering type regulatory sanction thus competent authorities may also consider requesting changes institutions capital plan may take number forms such potential restrictions dividends required bank maintain agreed trajectory its capital planning adverse scenario estimate european regulators had adopted approach forced banks stop paying dividends 2010 start sovereign debt crisis europe retained equity could paid more than 50 2016 capital shortfalls figure above shows our calculated capital shortfalls using eba stress test adverse scenario losses cumulative dividends these banks distributed since 2010 dividends paid out some banks such bnp paribas barclays actually exceed current capital shortfalls while others such deutsche bank commerzbank société générale capital shortfalls far exceed dividends would been retained latter banks would still require substantial capital issuances top dividend restrictions make up difference
nonetheless our findings suggest simple first step toward preventing bank capital erosion stop banks capital shortfalls paying dividends including internal dividends such employee bonuses such policy would even require regulators broach topics like capital issuance bailouts bail ins some banks even already begun suspend dividend payments left now european central bank enforce practice across eurozone new year banking union brussels five years after outbreak financial crisis europe economic political situation remains fragile mild recession expected europe year unemployment rise beyond deficit reduction need implement €120 billion 155 billion european investment plan deepen european single market unleash its growth potential but also need other structural measures european union must put end negative feedback loop between individual member states their national banking systems between 2008 2011 eu taxpayers granted banks €4.5 trillion loans guarantees
some countries threat bank recapitalization public funds resulted drop market confidence huge rise interest rates european central bank ecb taken decisive action break vicious circle moreover there now consensus 17 eurozone countries need banking union accompany their common currency european commission proposed single rulebook banks capital requirements mutual support between national deposit guarantee schemes europe wide rules resolving failing banks place main burden bank shareholders creditors taxpayers june 29 european heads state government committed themselves creation single european supervisor banks eurozone good news both financial stability public finances once single supervisor place supervision will more credible impartial important dealing ailing banks managing their return viability european commission also put forward set legislative proposals establish single supervisory mechanism confer key supervisory tasks ecb proposal must now amended approved soon possible european parliament council ministers chance activating european stability mechanism esm proceeding other essential pillars banking union further work however still needed several areas scope new supervisory mechanism
some member states favor restricting european supervision systemically important banks but commission believes should cover 6,000 banks eurozone after systemically important impossible define failures banks like northern rock dexia bankia reminders small medium size banks endanger entire financial system would inherently unstable two supervisory mechanisms banks operating same market.the participation non eurozone countries new supervisory scheme commission proposal confers powers ecb supervision banks eurozone non eurozone countries proposals provide mechanism join voluntary basis submit ecb authority but eu treaties make complicated give these non eurozone countries full voting powers i do see any political problem giving these countries full voice shaping decisions european supervisor but creativity will needed find legally sound fair solution.national supervisors role new system clearly european council decided paradigm shift powers moving ecb
but national supervisors will members board will take key decisions they will prepare implement current negotiations still fine tune roles european national supervisors but ultimate authority must rest ecb.non eurozone eu members do want join single supervisory mechanism these countries expressed concerns about new powers conferred ecb particular they question ecb's voting rights within european banking authority will remain charge developing single rulebook 27 countries eu single market enhancing convergence supervisory practices need find ways preserve fully influence non eurozone countries within european banking authority.democratic accountability ecb new supervisory powers ecb must course maintain its full monetary policy independence despite its new role so key question how addition giving important role european parliament national parliaments play their part overseeing supervisory decisions.timing according some eu countries commission proposal too ambitious enter into force beginning 2013 but effective single banking supervisor prerequisite esm direct recapitalization banks only possibility strong unified supervision will europe position break vicious circle between banks balance sheet weakness sovereign debt thus resolve eurozone crisis.entry into force january 2013 would bring about supervision ecb banks received requested public funding

when bubble burst ecb tried prevent excessive prices returning their equilibrium levels using its printing press promising unlimited coverage investors latest ecb measures just more same course when financial crisis erupted full force 2008 following collapse us investment bank lehman brothers ecb interventions were justified but after global economy started recover during latter part following year ecb moves became increasingly problematic because they enabled countries evade structural reform hindered necessary disinflation southern eurozone countries even halted altogether portugal italy southern europe had succumbed drug cheap credit but when private credit stalled symptoms withdrawal began appear ecb provided replacement drugs instead treating addiction created junkie economies were unable function without fix japan made similar mistake when its property bubble burst 1990 over two decades bank japan flooded economy money near zero interest rates japanese government its part followed such relentless policy deficit spending public debt jumped 67 gdp 246 gdp today latest upward push provided dubious abenomics economic strategy being pursued prime minister shinzo abe government none helped because neither monetary nor fiscal policy substitute structural reform
contrary more keynesian monetarist drugs administered feebler self healing power markets weaker willingness policymakers impose painful detoxification treatments economy populace but worst effects ecb policy may yet come eurozone still sound economies also become credit junkies there already some worrying signs property markets austria germany luxembourg practically exploded throughout crisis result banks chasing borrowers offers loans near zero interest rates regardless their creditworthiness austria property prices risen nearly half since lehman collapse luxembourg they risen almost third even germany europe largest economy been experiencing massive property boom since 2010 average urban property prices having risen more than third nearly half large cities country undergoing construction boom seen since reunification real estate agents only leftovers offer german property boom could reined appropriate jump interest rates but given ecb apparent determination head opposite direction bubble will only grow
bursts effects could dire euro new euro skeptic alternative germany party made astonishing headway country recent state elections would make sure eurozone minsky conundrum brussels stubbornly low inflation european central bank worried but its response essentially just more quantitative easing could backfire exacerbating imbalances generating serious financial instability stands headline consumer price index eurozone hovers around zero even core inflation remains below too far comfort ecb target around while new round weakness global commodity prices earlier year contributed these figures does explain weakness longer term inflation expectations improved little since march when ecb started its massive €60 billion 66.3 billion per month bond buying program but instead rethinking its strategy ecb considering doubling down buying even more bonds lowering its benchmark interest rate even further into negative territory would serious mistake easier credit conditions lower interest rates supposed boost growth stimulating investment consumption demand but core eurozone countries like germany netherlands credit been plentiful interest rates been close zero some time so there was never much chance bond purchases would significant impact there indeed european commission most recent economic forecast shows spending core countries increased result ecb policies germany external surplus actually increasing
course highly indebted peripheral countries there was room interest rates fall credit supply grow they leading governments households increase their spending while asymmetrical impact ecb policy appropriate principle because unemployment much higher periphery reality recovery supported least solvent economies sustainable back 1986 hyman minsky warned about longer term dangers financial stability ponzi borrowers those who service their debt only new debt become main pillar economy zero interest rate environment course ideal such borrowers because there nothing provide indication solvency borrowers just roll over their debt but bad those strong asset position reducing their spending power spurs them save even more standard response minsky concern spenders can’t afford savers aren’t spending monetary policy should focus ensuring price stability while macroprudential policy aims safeguard financial stability limiting borrowing highly indebted agents but approach does work macroprudential policy limited additional credit marginal borrowers effectively monetary policy would no impact demand long most solvent agents refuse spend more problem arose united states after 2001 recession although federal reserve kept interest rates low protracted period corporate sector did increase its investment
recovery was ultimately fueled so called subprime mortgages home purchase loans extended borrowers lower credit ratings result know was mega bubble triggered 2008 financial crisis eurozone case risk compounded ineffectiveness its key macroprudential instrument stability growth pact limiting countries spending lower interest rates give debtor countries leeway spend more public debt share gdp rise italy spain even though both countries their eurozone partners committed reducing debt ratio fact even without lower interest rates deficit limits pact imposes proved non binding exemplified france flouting them since 2009 short monetary policy perpetuating disequilibrium between creditor debtor economies eurozone macroprudential policy doing nothing stop when interest rates normalize could generate serious financial instability but conundrum ecb few options stimulating demand among eurozone more solvent agents thus supporting sustainable recovery deciding its next move whether initiate more bond purchases lower interest rates even further do both ecb must recognize any positive impact demand probably will limited eurozone weaker economies economies least afford high risk move probably justified effort bring price increases few dozen basis points closer ecb target
recovery already begun eurozone should left run its course even more expansionary monetary policy stance might strengthen recovery marginally but cost increasing eurozone already dangerous imbalances europe chimerical capital markets union london eurozone's survival doubt again greece demands debt forgiveness end austerity else but though europe's currency union risk its banking union remains early stage development endlessly creative european commission embarking another adventure so called capital markets union so called appropriate because project despite being only vaguely defined point most certainly intended create single european capital market indeed european union leaders know better than announce such ambition would require new treaty no prepared open up worms after european voters no mood transfer more powers brussels capital markets union actually began slogan coined eu commission president jean claude juncker's acolytes now new financial markets commissioner united kingdom's lord jonathan hill been assigned unenviable task putting flesh bare bones
commission's green paper consultation round subject produced more questions than answers think tanks lobby groups national regulators wasted no time trying influence hill's efforts head off any initiatives might damage their interests bank england argued there should no replication banking union grant new powers european central bank expense national central banks capital markets union boe argues does require institutional change so no super regulator should created commission accepted conclusion now though hill's aides suggested some point…supervisory issues will pop up fact establishing european version us securities exchange commission longstanding aim brussels eurocracy may achieved day but just yet but before delving into institutional issues favorite topic eu veterans should consider what problem capital markets union supposed solve here there considerable agreement most regulators market participants agree europe's financial markets dysfunctional banking assets amounting roughly 300 eu wide gdp compared some 70 united states large pools savings being left unused
moreover european companies receive excessive 80 their finance banks less than capital markets proportions roughly reversed us need redress imbalance become increasingly evident since recent financial crisis banks efforts rebuild their capital bases meet stricter regulatory requirements led credit rationing loosening constraint output growth would improve european economy's resilience encourage risk taking promote dynamism overall aim capital markets union thus relatively straightforward but achieving no small part because europe's heavy reliance bank finance stems structural cultural factors remedies commission suggested so far example encouraging crowdfunding standardizing terms securitization appear unlikely promote rapid growth non bank finance promoting pan european private placement market might help would aligning standards covered bonds but both strategies would face serious legal obstacles indeed though hill's modest initial agenda certainly would do no harm should pursued quickly possible any substantial measures beyond would confront major roadblocks example harmonizing insolvency regimes across continent reducing tax incentives favor debt over equity while entirely logical strike heart member states remaining sovereignty thus will extremely difficult push forward

brussels new european commission headed jean claude juncker off rocky start but would know reading news headlines sherlock holmes understood dog does bark nighttime usually goes unnoticed europe case european union fiscal rules issue commission principle eu watchdog should bark loudly when they flouted last month howls seemed inevitable after two large eu countries italy france submitted budget plans 2015 clearly violated their governments vows continued austerity first commission dutifully rejected two budgets incompatible rules eu stability growth pact sgp but something happened was curious arthur conan doyle story within days both countries offered mini adjustments their budgets worth about 0.2 gdp their finance ministers wrote commission their budgets should now approved commission did react leaving french italian leaders claim they brussels bureaucrats had last word fact latest forecast reflects even worse outcome france italy year than originally promised france deficit set increase slightly 2015 italy cyclically adjusted deficit expected deteriorate
stability growth pact prescribes annual improvement least 0.5 gdp new commission thus risks losing its authority very start its mandate whether does crucial question because maintaining high degree credibility essential economic policymaking eurozone see why worth recalling sgp original rules were judged stupid former commission president romano prodi because single minded pursuit deficit below gdp could inappropriate during recessions argument was accepted sgp was supposedly rendered more intelligent example permitting budget deficits adjusted economic cycle adding medium term objectives expenditure introducing escape clauses but new rules obviously require strong institution interpret them whose judgment accepted everybody though checking whether budget below sgp ceiling gdp may straightforward matter there reasonable disagreement about whether business cycle adjustment should estimated 0.5 0.8 gdp whether country adhering its medium term expenditure objective commission supposed last word thereby ensuring rules credibility consistency seems lost fight first round could course argue sgp should scrapped because austerity makes no sense when eurozone faces risk deflation but commission fiscally louche member countries should decide
other problem europe dog does bark but no reason case united kingdom been asked pay additional contribution eu budget about €2 billion 2.5 billion amounts rounding error uk own budget reason additional levy few weeks ago uk office national statistics announced proudly had discovered country gross national income gni had been much higher than previously assumed only 2013 but also previous years including revisions 2002 2012 period difference comes about £350 billion 560 billion because every eu member state obliged contribute about its gni union budget uk data revision had lead back payment billions euros but british prime minister david cameron government declared does intend pay money european commission was expecting does need these two cases dog should barked but did dog barked no reason threaten eu fundamental workings based clear rulebook enforced vigorously strong commission juncker commission risks losing its authority start rules bent broken accommodate larger member states domestic political priorities commission must regain political intellectual leadership make its choice either explain why sgp rules must followed even now face deflation agree those who argue current environment calls fiscal stimulus cannot avoid taking sides insisting publicly austerity rules but acquiescing when member states break them

rest question economic blackmail french diplomats course informed china about reluctance other european countries about lifting arms embargo was imposed after massacre tiananmen square 1989 china simply threatened abandon never conclude trade deals these eu members germans chinese probably murmur something about siemens volkswagen dutch their whispers most likely about philips china follows power game within eu through its french friends therefore knows governments need whipped into line sweden probably been enough whisper ericsson volvo make primer minister göran persson understand what stake his country commercially what european nation indeed dares put risk chinese order several billion euros typically enough no eu country mentioned taiwan reason resume arms exports instead eu talks code conduct probably does mean very much but sounds nice free trade another charming euphemism arms exports dictatorships

unfortunately another crisis two might necessary before european leaders consider seriously europe easy money endgame munich euro brought balance payments crisis europe just gold standard did 1920s fact there only difference between two episodes during today crisis huge international rescue packages been available these rescue packages relieved eurozone financial distress but high cost only they enabled investors avoid paying their poor decisions they also given overpriced southern european countries opportunity defer real depreciation form reduction relative prices goods necessary restore competitiveness was destroyed euro initial years when caused excessive inflation indeed countries like greece portugal spain regaining competitiveness would require them lower prices their own products relative rest eurozone about compared beginning crisis italy probably needs reduce its relative prices but portugal italy so far failed deliver any such real depreciation while relative prices greece spain fallen only respectively

according ecb president mario draghi inflation rate currently stands just below raised average just below would offer southern european countries way out their competitiveness trap because prices remained unchanged south while northern countries inflated southern countries could gradually reduce their goods relative prices without feeling too much pain course case north needs inflate faster than just say southern europe kept its inflation rate france inflated rate germany would inflate good rest eurozone annually reach eurozone average slightly less than pattern would continue about ten years bring eurozone back into balance point germany price level would about 50 higher than today i do expect qe bring about some inflation given exchange rate relative price currency more euros come into circulation their value fall substantially establish new equilibrium currency market experience similar programs united states united kingdom japan shown qe unleashes powerful forces depreciation qe eurozone will thus bring about inflation draghi wants via higher import export prices
whether effect will sufficient revitalize southern europe remains seen there risk japan china us will sit their hands while euro loses value world possibly even sliding into currency war moreover southern eu countries instead leaving prices unchanged could abandon austerity issue ever greater volume new bonds stimulate economy competitiveness gains rebalancing would fail materialize after initial flash pan eurozone would return permanent crisis euro finally fully discredited would meet very messy end only hope scenario does come pass southern countries stay course austerity their last chance europe america drumbeat war iran america capital once again abuzz talk war only latest strategy victory iraq but now also military action against iran harder becomes discern any rationality bush administration actions louder rumor mill grinds

brussels many europeans feel like their countries under assault huge numbers migrants flow across their borders whether they being exposed refugees firsthand just seeing images them splashed across newspaper pages europeans well aware vast numbers desperate people trying enter european union territory any means possible but awareness yet translate into unified response tensions among member states seem rising perhaps because problem differs so greatly across countries per capita basis sweden receives times more asylum applications than united kingdom where official policy toward refugees remains most hostile germany now become main destination overall receiving nearly 40 eu total even per capita basis several times more than eu average course there clear rules about how responsibility refugees delineated according so called dublin regulation first eu member state into refugee crosses responsible person asylum application but clearly problematic puts entire burden refugees eu frontier countries though may been huge problem 1990s when eu countries received only 300,000 asylum applications annually cannot work year when total expected triple number smaller border countries like hungary greece simply do capacity register house hundreds thousands asylum seekers
larger countries like italy incentive overlook large numbers refugees landing their shores knowing nothing done those refugees will likely head elsewhere mainly northern europe germany recognizing dublin system untenable now decided process asylum applications syrians regardless where they crossed into eu decision was likely driven least partly how difficult given eu porous internal borders determine where refugee first entered 2013 ruling european court justice germany could return iranian refugee greece where applicant was found face real risk being subjected inhuman degrading treatment probably heightened germany sense responsibility issue germany largest eu member country terms population gdp so some extent does make sense take lead but germany still accounts less than fifth eu population less than quarter its economy other words even germany handle europe refugees today few months ago european commission tried its hand resolving problem courageous proposal distribute refugees across member states according simple equation accounts population gdp but plan was rejected member states particularly those fewest refugees claiming represented undue interference domestic affairs put eu its usual quandary everybody recognizes there problem but solution requires unanimity cannot achieved because each country defends only its own interests
only way forward leave out countries most averse accepting immigrants least temporarily create solution involving just those willing share burden may seem fair but more refugees landing europe borders every day eu leaders cannot afford delay action but there another dimension crisis makes addressing more complicated migrants conflict areas like syria thus do according international law right asylum there also plenty economic migrants say poorer parts balkans hoping escape poverty home willing misuse asylum system process lodging application even without any chance being accepted appealing because until rejected applicant receives basic housing social services including health care pocket money amount may well exceed wages his her home country spending few months northern europe while asylum application processed far more attractive than going home job pays barely livable wage no job number asylum seekers increases so does time takes process their applications making system more tempting economic migrants indeed close half asylum seekers germany now come safe countries like serbia albania macedonia europe populists use such cases welfare tourism sow fear anger among european public reaching agreement accommodate actual refugees becomes increasingly difficult
against background eu needs take action two fronts first member countries must urgently boost their capacity deal asylum applications so they quickly identify those who deserve protection second eu needs improve burden sharing ideally among countries but perhaps among smaller group first providing shelter those who gain asylum international law basic morality demands nothing less turning off dividend spigot new york european banks high litigation restructuring costs resulted major losses their books abysmal stock market performance industry european regulators now reflect dismal state affairs search solutions they should consider banks revenue distribution including employee bonuses shareholder dividends part problem revenue distribution primary reason european banks capital shortfalls understand why should look back october 2014 when european banking authority began balance sheet stress tests eurozone largest 123 banks found capital shortfall €25 billion 28 billion them time eba required banks devise plans address their respective shortfalls within months
some banks took action raised equity through rights issues sometimes substantial help governments but most banks mollified regulators simply shedding riskier assets improve their capital ratios needless say these efforts were ineffective european banks share prices declined 50 average since initial 2014 assessment banks failed stress test didn’t take result seriously partly blame but so too regulators who did sufficiently hold banks feet fire improve their balance sheets who may applied stress tests were too weak detect financial frailty eba conducted another series stress tests reported results late july latest round looked 51 banks contrary previous tests was designed identify capital shortfalls but rather provide a common analytical framework consistently compare assess resilience large eu banks adverse economic developments regulators now suppose european banking sector resilient adverse shocks same day eba announcement worst performer italy banca monte dei paschi di siena announced €5 billion 5.6 billion new funding pursuant its €5.6 billion capital requirement still market reaction announcement was negative eurostoxx banks index fell 7.5 two days most likely because eba did include specific estimates european banks capital shortfalls outline recapitalization plan new paper investigating market reaction using united states capital requirement rules calculate total capital shortfall 51 participating banks €123 billion
despite large capital shortfall 28 34 publicly listed banks stress test paid out about €40 billion dividends 2015 meaning they distributed average over 60 their earnings shareholders dividend payments made under capitalized banks amount substantial wealth transfer subordinated bondholders shareholders because bondholders who will suffer losses crisis moreover potentially wealth transfer taxpayers private shareholders because under new banking rules government bailouts possible after bondholders covered bailed bank equity liabilities contrast undercapitalized banks us forced halt forms capital distribution they fail stress test fortunately following 2016 round stress tests eba now also considering type regulatory sanction thus competent authorities may also consider requesting changes institutions capital plan may take number forms such potential restrictions dividends required bank maintain agreed trajectory its capital planning adverse scenario estimate european regulators had adopted approach forced banks stop paying dividends 2010 start sovereign debt crisis europe retained equity could paid more than 50 2016 capital shortfalls figure above shows our calculated capital shortfalls using eba stress test adverse scenario losses cumulative dividends these banks distributed since 2010 dividends paid out some banks such bnp paribas barclays actually exceed current capital shortfalls while others such deutsche bank commerzbank société générale capital shortfalls far exceed dividends would been retained latter banks would still require substantial capital issuances top dividend restrictions make up difference
nonetheless our findings suggest simple first step toward preventing bank capital erosion stop banks capital shortfalls paying dividends including internal dividends such employee bonuses such policy would even require regulators broach topics like capital issuance bailouts bail ins some banks even already begun suspend dividend payments left now european central bank enforce practice across eurozone new year banking union brussels five years after outbreak financial crisis europe economic political situation remains fragile mild recession expected europe year unemployment rise beyond deficit reduction need implement €120 billion 155 billion european investment plan deepen european single market unleash its growth potential but also need other structural measures european union must put end negative feedback loop between individual member states their national banking systems between 2008 2011 eu taxpayers granted banks €4.5 trillion loans guarantees
some countries threat bank recapitalization public funds resulted drop market confidence huge rise interest rates european central bank ecb taken decisive action break vicious circle moreover there now consensus 17 eurozone countries need banking union accompany their common currency european commission proposed single rulebook banks capital requirements mutual support between national deposit guarantee schemes europe wide rules resolving failing banks place main burden bank shareholders creditors taxpayers june 29 european heads state government committed themselves creation single european supervisor banks eurozone good news both financial stability public finances once single supervisor place supervision will more credible impartial important dealing ailing banks managing their return viability european commission also put forward set legislative proposals establish single supervisory mechanism confer key supervisory tasks ecb proposal must now amended approved soon possible european parliament council ministers chance activating european stability mechanism esm proceeding other essential pillars banking union further work however still needed several areas scope new supervisory mechanism
some member states favor restricting european supervision systemically important banks but commission believes should cover 6,000 banks eurozone after systemically important impossible define failures banks like northern rock dexia bankia reminders small medium size banks endanger entire financial system would inherently unstable two supervisory mechanisms banks operating same market.the participation non eurozone countries new supervisory scheme commission proposal confers powers ecb supervision banks eurozone non eurozone countries proposals provide mechanism join voluntary basis submit ecb authority but eu treaties make complicated give these non eurozone countries full voting powers i do see any political problem giving these countries full voice shaping decisions european supervisor but creativity will needed find legally sound fair solution.national supervisors role new system clearly european council decided paradigm shift powers moving ecb
but national supervisors will members board will take key decisions they will prepare implement current negotiations still fine tune roles european national supervisors but ultimate authority must rest ecb.non eurozone eu members do want join single supervisory mechanism these countries expressed concerns about new powers conferred ecb particular they question ecb's voting rights within european banking authority will remain charge developing single rulebook 27 countries eu single market enhancing convergence supervisory practices need find ways preserve fully influence non eurozone countries within european banking authority.democratic accountability ecb new supervisory powers ecb must course maintain its full monetary policy independence despite its new role so key question how addition giving important role european parliament national parliaments play their part overseeing supervisory decisions.timing according some eu countries commission proposal too ambitious enter into force beginning 2013 but effective single banking supervisor prerequisite esm direct recapitalization banks only possibility strong unified supervision will europe position break vicious circle between banks balance sheet weakness sovereign debt thus resolve eurozone crisis.entry into force january 2013 would bring about supervision ecb banks received requested public funding

when bubble burst ecb tried prevent excessive prices returning their equilibrium levels using its printing press promising unlimited coverage investors latest ecb measures just more same course when financial crisis erupted full force 2008 following collapse us investment bank lehman brothers ecb interventions were justified but after global economy started recover during latter part following year ecb moves became increasingly problematic because they enabled countries evade structural reform hindered necessary disinflation southern eurozone countries even halted altogether portugal italy southern europe had succumbed drug cheap credit but when private credit stalled symptoms withdrawal began appear ecb provided replacement drugs instead treating addiction created junkie economies were unable function without fix japan made similar mistake when its property bubble burst 1990 over two decades bank japan flooded economy money near zero interest rates japanese government its part followed such relentless policy deficit spending public debt jumped 67 gdp 246 gdp today latest upward push provided dubious abenomics economic strategy being pursued prime minister shinzo abe government none helped because neither monetary nor fiscal policy substitute structural reform
contrary more keynesian monetarist drugs administered feebler self healing power markets weaker willingness policymakers impose painful detoxification treatments economy populace but worst effects ecb policy may yet come eurozone still sound economies also become credit junkies there already some worrying signs property markets austria germany luxembourg practically exploded throughout crisis result banks chasing borrowers offers loans near zero interest rates regardless their creditworthiness austria property prices risen nearly half since lehman collapse luxembourg they risen almost third even germany europe largest economy been experiencing massive property boom since 2010 average urban property prices having risen more than third nearly half large cities country undergoing construction boom seen since reunification real estate agents only leftovers offer german property boom could reined appropriate jump interest rates but given ecb apparent determination head opposite direction bubble will only grow
bursts effects could dire euro new euro skeptic alternative germany party made astonishing headway country recent state elections would make sure eurozone minsky conundrum brussels stubbornly low inflation european central bank worried but its response essentially just more quantitative easing could backfire exacerbating imbalances generating serious financial instability stands headline consumer price index eurozone hovers around zero even core inflation remains below too far comfort ecb target around while new round weakness global commodity prices earlier year contributed these figures does explain weakness longer term inflation expectations improved little since march when ecb started its massive €60 billion 66.3 billion per month bond buying program but instead rethinking its strategy ecb considering doubling down buying even more bonds lowering its benchmark interest rate even further into negative territory would serious mistake easier credit conditions lower interest rates supposed boost growth stimulating investment consumption demand but core eurozone countries like germany netherlands credit been plentiful interest rates been close zero some time so there was never much chance bond purchases would significant impact there indeed european commission most recent economic forecast shows spending core countries increased result ecb policies germany external surplus actually increasing

recovery already begun eurozone should left run its course even more expansionary monetary policy stance might strengthen recovery marginally but cost increasing eurozone already dangerous imbalances europe chimerical capital markets union london eurozone's survival doubt again greece demands debt forgiveness end austerity else but though europe's currency union risk its banking union remains early stage development endlessly creative european commission embarking another adventure so called capital markets union so called appropriate because project despite being only vaguely defined point most certainly intended create single european capital market indeed european union leaders know better than announce such ambition would require new treaty no prepared open up worms after european voters no mood transfer more powers brussels capital markets union actually began slogan coined eu commission president jean claude juncker's acolytes now new financial markets commissioner united kingdom's lord jonathan hill been assigned unenviable task putting flesh bare bones
commission's green paper consultation round subject produced more questions than answers think tanks lobby groups national regulators wasted no time trying influence hill's efforts head off any initiatives might damage their interests bank england argued there should no replication banking union grant new powers european central bank expense national central banks capital markets union boe argues does require institutional change so no super regulator should created commission accepted conclusion now though hill's aides suggested some point…supervisory issues will pop up fact establishing european version us securities exchange commission longstanding aim brussels eurocracy may achieved day but just yet but before delving into institutional issues favorite topic eu veterans should consider what problem capital markets union supposed solve here there considerable agreement most regulators market participants agree europe's financial markets dysfunctional banking assets amounting roughly 300 eu wide gdp compared some 70 united states large pools savings being left unused
moreover european companies receive excessive 80 their finance banks less than capital markets proportions roughly reversed us need redress imbalance become increasingly evident since recent financial crisis banks efforts rebuild their capital bases meet stricter regulatory requirements led credit rationing loosening constraint output growth would improve european economy's resilience encourage risk taking promote dynamism overall aim capital markets union thus relatively straightforward but achieving no small part because europe's heavy reliance bank finance stems structural cultural factors remedies commission suggested so far example encouraging crowdfunding standardizing terms securitization appear unlikely promote rapid growth non bank finance promoting pan european private placement market might help would aligning standards covered bonds but both strategies would face serious legal obstacles indeed though hill's modest initial agenda certainly would do no harm should pursued quickly possible any substantial measures beyond would confront major roadblocks example harmonizing insolvency regimes across continent reducing tax incentives favor debt over equity while entirely logical strike heart member states remaining sovereignty thus will extremely difficult push forward

brussels new european commission headed jean claude juncker off rocky start but would know reading news headlines sherlock holmes understood dog does bark nighttime usually goes unnoticed europe case european union fiscal rules issue commission principle eu watchdog should bark loudly when they flouted last month howls seemed inevitable after two large eu countries italy france submitted budget plans 2015 clearly violated their governments vows continued austerity first commission dutifully rejected two budgets incompatible rules eu stability growth pact sgp but something happened was curious arthur conan doyle story within days both countries offered mini adjustments their budgets worth about 0.2 gdp their finance ministers wrote commission their budgets should now approved commission did react leaving french italian leaders claim they brussels bureaucrats had last word fact latest forecast reflects even worse outcome france italy year than originally promised france deficit set increase slightly 2015 italy cyclically adjusted deficit expected deteriorate
stability growth pact prescribes annual improvement least 0.5 gdp new commission thus risks losing its authority very start its mandate whether does crucial question because maintaining high degree credibility essential economic policymaking eurozone see why worth recalling sgp original rules were judged stupid former commission president romano prodi because single minded pursuit deficit below gdp could inappropriate during recessions argument was accepted sgp was supposedly rendered more intelligent example permitting budget deficits adjusted economic cycle adding medium term objectives expenditure introducing escape clauses but new rules obviously require strong institution interpret them whose judgment accepted everybody though checking whether budget below sgp ceiling gdp may straightforward matter there reasonable disagreement about whether business cycle adjustment should estimated 0.5 0.8 gdp whether country adhering its medium term expenditure objective commission supposed last word thereby ensuring rules credibility consistency seems lost fight first round could course argue sgp should scrapped because austerity makes no sense when eurozone faces risk deflation but commission fiscally louche member countries should decide

unfortunately another crisis two might necessary before european leaders consider seriously europe easy money endgame munich euro brought balance payments crisis europe just gold standard did 1920s fact there only difference between two episodes during today crisis huge international rescue packages been available these rescue packages relieved eurozone financial distress but high cost only they enabled investors avoid paying their poor decisions they also given overpriced southern european countries opportunity defer real depreciation form reduction relative prices goods necessary restore competitiveness was destroyed euro initial years when caused excessive inflation indeed countries like greece portugal spain regaining competitiveness would require them lower prices their own products relative rest eurozone about compared beginning crisis italy probably needs reduce its relative prices but portugal italy so far failed deliver any such real depreciation while relative prices greece spain fallen only respectively

according ecb president mario draghi inflation rate currently stands just below raised average just below would offer southern european countries way out their competitiveness trap because prices remained unchanged south while northern countries inflated southern countries could gradually reduce their goods relative prices without feeling too much pain course case north needs inflate faster than just say southern europe kept its inflation rate france inflated rate germany would inflate good rest eurozone annually reach eurozone average slightly less than pattern would continue about ten years bring eurozone back into balance point germany price level would about 50 higher than today i do expect qe bring about some inflation given exchange rate relative price currency more euros come into circulation their value fall substantially establish new equilibrium currency market experience similar programs united states united kingdom japan shown qe unleashes powerful forces depreciation qe eurozone will thus bring about inflation draghi wants via higher import export prices
whether effect will sufficient revitalize southern europe remains seen there risk japan china us will sit their hands while euro loses value world possibly even sliding into currency war moreover southern eu countries instead leaving prices unchanged could abandon austerity issue ever greater volume new bonds stimulate economy competitiveness gains rebalancing would fail materialize after initial flash pan eurozone would return permanent crisis euro finally fully discredited would meet very messy end only hope scenario does come pass southern countries stay course austerity their last chance europe america drumbeat war iran america capital once again abuzz talk war only latest strategy victory iraq but now also military action against iran harder becomes discern any rationality bush administration actions louder rumor mill grinds

brussels many europeans feel like their countries under assault huge numbers migrants flow across their borders whether they being exposed refugees firsthand just seeing images them splashed across newspaper pages europeans well aware vast numbers desperate people trying enter european union territory any means possible but awareness yet translate into unified response tensions among member states seem rising perhaps because problem differs so greatly across countries per capita basis sweden receives times more asylum applications than united kingdom where official policy toward refugees remains most hostile germany now become main destination overall receiving nearly 40 eu total even per capita basis several times more than eu average course there clear rules about how responsibility refugees delineated according so called dublin regulation first eu member state into refugee crosses responsible person asylum application but clearly problematic puts entire burden refugees eu frontier countries though may been huge problem 1990s when eu countries received only 300,000 asylum applications annually cannot work year when total expected triple number smaller border countries like hungary greece simply do capacity register house hundreds thousands asylum seekers
larger countries like italy incentive overlook large numbers refugees landing their shores knowing nothing done those refugees will likely head elsewhere mainly northern europe germany recognizing dublin system untenable now decided process asylum applications syrians regardless where they crossed into eu decision was likely driven least partly how difficult given eu porous internal borders determine where refugee first entered 2013 ruling european court justice germany could return iranian refugee greece where applicant was found face real risk being subjected inhuman degrading treatment probably heightened germany sense responsibility issue germany largest eu member country terms population gdp so some extent does make sense take lead but germany still accounts less than fifth eu population less than quarter its economy other words even germany handle europe refugees today few months ago european commission tried its hand resolving problem courageous proposal distribute refugees across member states according simple equation accounts population gdp but plan was rejected member states particularly those fewest refugees claiming represented undue interference domestic affairs put eu its usual quandary everybody recognizes there problem but solution requires unanimity cannot achieved because each country defends only its own interests
only way forward leave out countries most averse accepting immigrants least temporarily create solution involving just those willing share burden may seem fair but more refugees landing europe borders every day eu leaders cannot afford delay action but there another dimension crisis makes addressing more complicated migrants conflict areas like syria thus do according international law right asylum there also plenty economic migrants say poorer parts balkans hoping escape poverty home willing misuse asylum system process lodging application even without any chance being accepted appealing because until rejected applicant receives basic housing social services including health care pocket money amount may well exceed wages his her home country spending few months northern europe while asylum application processed far more attractive than going home job pays barely livable wage no job number asylum seekers increases so does time takes process their applications making system more tempting economic migrants indeed close half asylum seekers germany now come safe countries like serbia albania macedonia europe populists use such cases welfare tourism sow fear anger among european public reaching agreement accommodate actual refugees becomes increasingly difficult
against background eu needs take action two fronts first member countries must urgently boost their capacity deal asylum applications so they quickly identify those who deserve protection second eu needs improve burden sharing ideally among countries but perhaps among smaller group first providing shelter those who gain asylum international law basic morality demands nothing less turning off dividend spigot new york european banks high litigation restructuring costs resulted major losses their books abysmal stock market performance industry european regulators now reflect dismal state affairs search solutions they should consider banks revenue distribution including employee bonuses shareholder dividends part problem revenue distribution primary reason european banks capital shortfalls understand why should look back october 2014 when european banking authority began balance sheet stress tests eurozone largest 123 banks found capital shortfall €25 billion 28 billion them time eba required banks devise plans address their respective shortfalls within months
some banks took action raised equity through rights issues sometimes substantial help governments but most banks mollified regulators simply shedding riskier assets improve their capital ratios needless say these efforts were ineffective european banks share prices declined 50 average since initial 2014 assessment banks failed stress test didn’t take result seriously partly blame but so too regulators who did sufficiently hold banks feet fire improve their balance sheets who may applied stress tests were too weak detect financial frailty eba conducted another series stress tests reported results late july latest round looked 51 banks contrary previous tests was designed identify capital shortfalls but rather provide a common analytical framework consistently compare assess resilience large eu banks adverse economic developments regulators now suppose european banking sector resilient adverse shocks same day eba announcement worst performer italy banca monte dei paschi di siena announced €5 billion 5.6 billion new funding pursuant its €5.6 billion capital requirement still market reaction announcement was negative eurostoxx banks index fell 7.5 two days most likely because eba did include specific estimates european banks capital shortfalls outline recapitalization plan new paper investigating market reaction using united states capital requirement rules calculate total capital shortfall 51 participating banks €123 billion
despite large capital shortfall 28 34 publicly listed banks stress test paid out about €40 billion dividends 2015 meaning they distributed average over 60 their earnings shareholders dividend payments made under capitalized banks amount substantial wealth transfer subordinated bondholders shareholders because bondholders who will suffer losses crisis moreover potentially wealth transfer taxpayers private shareholders because under new banking rules government bailouts possible after bondholders covered bailed bank equity liabilities contrast undercapitalized banks us forced halt forms capital distribution they fail stress test fortunately following 2016 round stress tests eba now also considering type regulatory sanction thus competent authorities may also consider requesting changes institutions capital plan may take number forms such potential restrictions dividends required bank maintain agreed trajectory its capital planning adverse scenario estimate european regulators had adopted approach forced banks stop paying dividends 2010 start sovereign debt crisis europe retained equity could paid more than 50 2016 capital shortfalls figure above shows our calculated capital shortfalls using eba stress test adverse scenario losses cumulative dividends these banks distributed since 2010 dividends paid out some banks such bnp paribas barclays actually exceed current capital shortfalls while others such deutsche bank commerzbank société générale capital shortfalls far exceed dividends would been retained latter banks would still require substantial capital issuances top dividend restrictions make up difference
nonetheless our findings suggest simple first step toward preventing bank capital erosion stop banks capital shortfalls paying dividends including internal dividends such employee bonuses such policy would even require regulators broach topics like capital issuance bailouts bail ins some banks even already begun suspend dividend payments left now european central bank enforce practice across eurozone new year banking union brussels five years after outbreak financial crisis europe economic political situation remains fragile mild recession expected europe year unemployment rise beyond deficit reduction need implement €120 billion 155 billion european investment plan deepen european single market unleash its growth potential but also need other structural measures european union must put end negative feedback loop between individual member states their national banking systems between 2008 2011 eu taxpayers granted banks €4.5 trillion loans guarantees
some countries threat bank recapitalization public funds resulted drop market confidence huge rise interest rates european central bank ecb taken decisive action break vicious circle moreover there now consensus 17 eurozone countries need banking union accompany their common currency european commission proposed single rulebook banks capital requirements mutual support between national deposit guarantee schemes europe wide rules resolving failing banks place main burden bank shareholders creditors taxpayers june 29 european heads state government committed themselves creation single european supervisor banks eurozone good news both financial stability public finances once single supervisor place supervision will more credible impartial important dealing ailing banks managing their return viability european commission also put forward set legislative proposals establish single supervisory mechanism confer key supervisory tasks ecb proposal must now amended approved soon possible european parliament council ministers chance activating european stability mechanism esm proceeding other essential pillars banking union further work however still needed several areas scope new supervisory mechanism
some member states favor restricting european supervision systemically important banks but commission believes should cover 6,000 banks eurozone after systemically important impossible define failures banks like northern rock dexia bankia reminders small medium size banks endanger entire financial system would inherently unstable two supervisory mechanisms banks operating same market.the participation non eurozone countries new supervisory scheme commission proposal confers powers ecb supervision banks eurozone non eurozone countries proposals provide mechanism join voluntary basis submit ecb authority but eu treaties make complicated give these non eurozone countries full voting powers i do see any political problem giving these countries full voice shaping decisions european supervisor but creativity will needed find legally sound fair solution.national supervisors role new system clearly european council decided paradigm shift powers moving ecb
but national supervisors will members board will take key decisions they will prepare implement current negotiations still fine tune roles european national supervisors but ultimate authority must rest ecb.non eurozone eu members do want join single supervisory mechanism these countries expressed concerns about new powers conferred ecb particular they question ecb's voting rights within european banking authority will remain charge developing single rulebook 27 countries eu single market enhancing convergence supervisory practices need find ways preserve fully influence non eurozone countries within european banking authority.democratic accountability ecb new supervisory powers ecb must course maintain its full monetary policy independence despite its new role so key question how addition giving important role european parliament national parliaments play their part overseeing supervisory decisions.timing according some eu countries commission proposal too ambitious enter into force beginning 2013 but effective single banking supervisor prerequisite esm direct recapitalization banks only possibility strong unified supervision will europe position break vicious circle between banks balance sheet weakness sovereign debt thus resolve eurozone crisis.entry into force january 2013 would bring about supervision ecb banks received requested public funding

when bubble burst ecb tried prevent excessive prices returning their equilibrium levels using its printing press promising unlimited coverage investors latest ecb measures just more same course when financial crisis erupted full force 2008 following collapse us investment bank lehman brothers ecb interventions were justified but after global economy started recover during latter part following year ecb moves became increasingly problematic because they enabled countries evade structural reform hindered necessary disinflation southern eurozone countries even halted altogether portugal italy southern europe had succumbed drug cheap credit but when private credit stalled symptoms withdrawal began appear ecb provided replacement drugs instead treating addiction created junkie economies were unable function without fix japan made similar mistake when its property bubble burst 1990 over two decades bank japan flooded economy money near zero interest rates japanese government its part followed such relentless policy deficit spending public debt jumped 67 gdp 246 gdp today latest upward push provided dubious abenomics economic strategy being pursued prime minister shinzo abe government none helped because neither monetary nor fiscal policy substitute structural reform
contrary more keynesian monetarist drugs administered feebler self healing power markets weaker willingness policymakers impose painful detoxification treatments economy populace but worst effects ecb policy may yet come eurozone still sound economies also become credit junkies there already some worrying signs property markets austria germany luxembourg practically exploded throughout crisis result banks chasing borrowers offers loans near zero interest rates regardless their creditworthiness austria property prices risen nearly half since lehman collapse luxembourg they risen almost third even germany europe largest economy been experiencing massive property boom since 2010 average urban property prices having risen more than third nearly half large cities country undergoing construction boom seen since reunification real estate agents only leftovers offer german property boom could reined appropriate jump interest rates but given ecb apparent determination head opposite direction bubble will only grow
bursts effects could dire euro new euro skeptic alternative germany party made astonishing headway country recent state elections would make sure eurozone minsky conundrum brussels stubbornly low inflation european central bank worried but its response essentially just more quantitative easing could backfire exacerbating imbalances generating serious financial instability stands headline consumer price index eurozone hovers around zero even core inflation remains below too far comfort ecb target around while new round weakness global commodity prices earlier year contributed these figures does explain weakness longer term inflation expectations improved little since march when ecb started its massive €60 billion 66.3 billion per month bond buying program but instead rethinking its strategy ecb considering doubling down buying even more bonds lowering its benchmark interest rate even further into negative territory would serious mistake easier credit conditions lower interest rates supposed boost growth stimulating investment consumption demand but core eurozone countries like germany netherlands credit been plentiful interest rates been close zero some time so there was never much chance bond purchases would significant impact there indeed european commission most recent economic forecast shows spending core countries increased result ecb policies germany external surplus actually increasing

recovery already begun eurozone should left run its course even more expansionary monetary policy stance might strengthen recovery marginally but cost increasing eurozone already dangerous imbalances europe chimerical capital markets union london eurozone's survival doubt again greece demands debt forgiveness end austerity else but though europe's currency union risk its banking union remains early stage development endlessly creative european commission embarking another adventure so called capital markets union so called appropriate because project despite being only vaguely defined point most certainly intended create single european capital market indeed european union leaders know better than announce such ambition would require new treaty no prepared open up worms after european voters no mood transfer more powers brussels capital markets union actually began slogan coined eu commission president jean claude juncker's acolytes now new financial markets commissioner united kingdom's lord jonathan hill been assigned unenviable task putting flesh bare bones
commission's green paper consultation round subject produced more questions than answers think tanks lobby groups national regulators wasted no time trying influence hill's efforts head off any initiatives might damage their interests bank england argued there should no replication banking union grant new powers european central bank expense national central banks capital markets union boe argues does require institutional change so no super regulator should created commission accepted conclusion now though hill's aides suggested some point…supervisory issues will pop up fact establishing european version us securities exchange commission longstanding aim brussels eurocracy may achieved day but just yet but before delving into institutional issues favorite topic eu veterans should consider what problem capital markets union supposed solve here there considerable agreement most regulators market participants agree europe's financial markets dysfunctional banking assets amounting roughly 300 eu wide gdp compared some 70 united states large pools savings being left unused
moreover european companies receive excessive 80 their finance banks less than capital markets proportions roughly reversed us need redress imbalance become increasingly evident since recent financial crisis banks efforts rebuild their capital bases meet stricter regulatory requirements led credit rationing loosening constraint output growth would improve european economy's resilience encourage risk taking promote dynamism overall aim capital markets union thus relatively straightforward but achieving no small part because europe's heavy reliance bank finance stems structural cultural factors remedies commission suggested so far example encouraging crowdfunding standardizing terms securitization appear unlikely promote rapid growth non bank finance promoting pan european private placement market might help would aligning standards covered bonds but both strategies would face serious legal obstacles indeed though hill's modest initial agenda certainly would do no harm should pursued quickly possible any substantial measures beyond would confront major roadblocks example harmonizing insolvency regimes across continent reducing tax incentives favor debt over equity while entirely logical strike heart member states remaining sovereignty thus will extremely difficult push forward

brussels new european commission headed jean claude juncker off rocky start but would know reading news headlines sherlock holmes understood dog does bark nighttime usually goes unnoticed europe case european union fiscal rules issue commission principle eu watchdog should bark loudly when they flouted last month howls seemed inevitable after two large eu countries italy france submitted budget plans 2015 clearly violated their governments vows continued austerity first commission dutifully rejected two budgets incompatible rules eu stability growth pact sgp but something happened was curious arthur conan doyle story within days both countries offered mini adjustments their budgets worth about 0.2 gdp their finance ministers wrote commission their budgets should now approved commission did react leaving french italian leaders claim they brussels bureaucrats had last word fact latest forecast reflects even worse outcome france italy year than originally promised france deficit set increase slightly 2015 italy cyclically adjusted deficit expected deteriorate
stability growth pact prescribes annual improvement least 0.5 gdp new commission thus risks losing its authority very start its mandate whether does crucial question because maintaining high degree credibility essential economic policymaking eurozone see why worth recalling sgp original rules were judged stupid former commission president romano prodi because single minded pursuit deficit below gdp could inappropriate during recessions argument was accepted sgp was supposedly rendered more intelligent example permitting budget deficits adjusted economic cycle adding medium term objectives expenditure introducing escape clauses but new rules obviously require strong institution interpret them whose judgment accepted everybody though checking whether budget below sgp ceiling gdp may straightforward matter there reasonable disagreement about whether business cycle adjustment should estimated 0.5 0.8 gdp whether country adhering its medium term expenditure objective commission supposed last word thereby ensuring rules credibility consistency seems lost fight first round could course argue sgp should scrapped because austerity makes no sense when eurozone faces risk deflation but commission fiscally louche member countries should decide

unfortunately another crisis two might necessary before european leaders consider seriously europe easy money endgame munich euro brought balance payments crisis europe just gold standard did 1920s fact there only difference between two episodes during today crisis huge international rescue packages been available these rescue packages relieved eurozone financial distress but high cost only they enabled investors avoid paying their poor decisions they also given overpriced southern european countries opportunity defer real depreciation form reduction relative prices goods necessary restore competitiveness was destroyed euro initial years when caused excessive inflation indeed countries like greece portugal spain regaining competitiveness would require them lower prices their own products relative rest eurozone about compared beginning crisis italy probably needs reduce its relative prices but portugal italy so far failed deliver any such real depreciation while relative prices greece spain fallen only respectively

according ecb president mario draghi inflation rate currently stands just below raised average just below would offer southern european countries way out their competitiveness trap because prices remained unchanged south while northern countries inflated southern countries could gradually reduce their goods relative prices without feeling too much pain course case north needs inflate faster than just say southern europe kept its inflation rate france inflated rate germany would inflate good rest eurozone annually reach eurozone average slightly less than pattern would continue about ten years bring eurozone back into balance point germany price level would about 50 higher than today i do expect qe bring about some inflation given exchange rate relative price currency more euros come into circulation their value fall substantially establish new equilibrium currency market experience similar programs united states united kingdom japan shown qe unleashes powerful forces depreciation qe eurozone will thus bring about inflation draghi wants via higher import export prices
whether effect will sufficient revitalize southern europe remains seen there risk japan china us will sit their hands while euro loses value world possibly even sliding into currency war moreover southern eu countries instead leaving prices unchanged could abandon austerity issue ever greater volume new bonds stimulate economy competitiveness gains rebalancing would fail materialize after initial flash pan eurozone would return permanent crisis euro finally fully discredited would meet very messy end only hope scenario does come pass southern countries stay course austerity their last chance europe america drumbeat war iran america capital once again abuzz talk war only latest strategy victory iraq but now also military action against iran harder becomes discern any rationality bush administration actions louder rumor mill grinds

brussels many europeans feel like their countries under assault huge numbers migrants flow across their borders whether they being exposed refugees firsthand just seeing images them splashed across newspaper pages europeans well aware vast numbers desperate people trying enter european union territory any means possible but awareness yet translate into unified response tensions among member states seem rising perhaps because problem differs so greatly across countries per capita basis sweden receives times more asylum applications than united kingdom where official policy toward refugees remains most hostile germany now become main destination overall receiving nearly 40 eu total even per capita basis several times more than eu average course there clear rules about how responsibility refugees delineated according so called dublin regulation first eu member state into refugee crosses responsible person asylum application but clearly problematic puts entire burden refugees eu frontier countries though may been huge problem 1990s when eu countries received only 300,000 asylum applications annually cannot work year when total expected triple number smaller border countries like hungary greece simply do capacity register house hundreds thousands asylum seekers
larger countries like italy incentive overlook large numbers refugees landing their shores knowing nothing done those refugees will likely head elsewhere mainly northern europe germany recognizing dublin system untenable now decided process asylum applications syrians regardless where they crossed into eu decision was likely driven least partly how difficult given eu porous internal borders determine where refugee first entered 2013 ruling european court justice germany could return iranian refugee greece where applicant was found face real risk being subjected inhuman degrading treatment probably heightened germany sense responsibility issue germany largest eu member country terms population gdp so some extent does make sense take lead but germany still accounts less than fifth eu population less than quarter its economy other words even germany handle europe refugees today few months ago european commission tried its hand resolving problem courageous proposal distribute refugees across member states according simple equation accounts population gdp but plan was rejected member states particularly those fewest refugees claiming represented undue interference domestic affairs put eu its usual quandary everybody recognizes there problem but solution requires unanimity cannot achieved because each country defends only its own interests
only way forward leave out countries most averse accepting immigrants least temporarily create solution involving just those willing share burden may seem fair but more refugees landing europe borders every day eu leaders cannot afford delay action but there another dimension crisis makes addressing more complicated migrants conflict areas like syria thus do according international law right asylum there also plenty economic migrants say poorer parts balkans hoping escape poverty home willing misuse asylum system process lodging application even without any chance being accepted appealing because until rejected applicant receives basic housing social services including health care pocket money amount may well exceed wages his her home country spending few months northern europe while asylum application processed far more attractive than going home job pays barely livable wage no job number asylum seekers increases so does time takes process their applications making system more tempting economic migrants indeed close half asylum seekers germany now come safe countries like serbia albania macedonia europe populists use such cases welfare tourism sow fear anger among european public reaching agreement accommodate actual refugees becomes increasingly difficult
against background eu needs take action two fronts first member countries must urgently boost their capacity deal asylum applications so they quickly identify those who deserve protection second eu needs improve burden sharing ideally among countries but perhaps among smaller group first providing shelter those who gain asylum international law basic morality demands nothing less turning off dividend spigot new york european banks high litigation restructuring costs resulted major losses their books abysmal stock market performance industry european regulators now reflect dismal state affairs search solutions they should consider banks revenue distribution including employee bonuses shareholder dividends part problem revenue distribution primary reason european banks capital shortfalls understand why should look back october 2014 when european banking authority began balance sheet stress tests eurozone largest 123 banks found capital shortfall €25 billion 28 billion them time eba required banks devise plans address their respective shortfalls within months
some banks took action raised equity through rights issues sometimes substantial help governments but most banks mollified regulators simply shedding riskier assets improve their capital ratios needless say these efforts were ineffective european banks share prices declined 50 average since initial 2014 assessment banks failed stress test didn’t take result seriously partly blame but so too regulators who did sufficiently hold banks feet fire improve their balance sheets who may applied stress tests were too weak detect financial frailty eba conducted another series stress tests reported results late july latest round looked 51 banks contrary previous tests was designed identify capital shortfalls but rather provide a common analytical framework consistently compare assess resilience large eu banks adverse economic developments regulators now suppose european banking sector resilient adverse shocks same day eba announcement worst performer italy banca monte dei paschi di siena announced €5 billion 5.6 billion new funding pursuant its €5.6 billion capital requirement still market reaction announcement was negative eurostoxx banks index fell 7.5 two days most likely because eba did include specific estimates european banks capital shortfalls outline recapitalization plan new paper investigating market reaction using united states capital requirement rules calculate total capital shortfall 51 participating banks €123 billion
despite large capital shortfall 28 34 publicly listed banks stress test paid out about €40 billion dividends 2015 meaning they distributed average over 60 their earnings shareholders dividend payments made under capitalized banks amount substantial wealth transfer subordinated bondholders shareholders because bondholders who will suffer losses crisis moreover potentially wealth transfer taxpayers private shareholders because under new banking rules government bailouts possible after bondholders covered bailed bank equity liabilities contrast undercapitalized banks us forced halt forms capital distribution they fail stress test fortunately following 2016 round stress tests eba now also considering type regulatory sanction thus competent authorities may also consider requesting changes institutions capital plan may take number forms such potential restrictions dividends required bank maintain agreed trajectory its capital planning adverse scenario estimate european regulators had adopted approach forced banks stop paying dividends 2010 start sovereign debt crisis europe retained equity could paid more than 50 2016 capital shortfalls figure above shows our calculated capital shortfalls using eba stress test adverse scenario losses cumulative dividends these banks distributed since 2010 dividends paid out some banks such bnp paribas barclays actually exceed current capital shortfalls while others such deutsche bank commerzbank société générale capital shortfalls far exceed dividends would been retained latter banks would still require substantial capital issuances top dividend restrictions make up difference
nonetheless our findings suggest simple first step toward preventing bank capital erosion stop banks capital shortfalls paying dividends including internal dividends such employee bonuses such policy would even require regulators broach topics like capital issuance bailouts bail ins some banks even already begun suspend dividend payments left now european central bank enforce practice across eurozone new year banking union brussels five years after outbreak financial crisis europe economic political situation remains fragile mild recession expected europe year unemployment rise beyond deficit reduction need implement €120 billion 155 billion european investment plan deepen european single market unleash its growth potential but also need other structural measures european union must put end negative feedback loop between individual member states their national banking systems between 2008 2011 eu taxpayers granted banks €4.5 trillion loans guarantees
some countries threat bank recapitalization public funds resulted drop market confidence huge rise interest rates european central bank ecb taken decisive action break vicious circle moreover there now consensus 17 eurozone countries need banking union accompany their common currency european commission proposed single rulebook banks capital requirements mutual support between national deposit guarantee schemes europe wide rules resolving failing banks place main burden bank shareholders creditors taxpayers june 29 european heads state government committed themselves creation single european supervisor banks eurozone good news both financial stability public finances once single supervisor place supervision will more credible impartial important dealing ailing banks managing their return viability european commission also put forward set legislative proposals establish single supervisory mechanism confer key supervisory tasks ecb proposal must now amended approved soon possible european parliament council ministers chance activating european stability mechanism esm proceeding other essential pillars banking union further work however still needed several areas scope new supervisory mechanism
some member states favor restricting european supervision systemically important banks but commission believes should cover 6,000 banks eurozone after systemically important impossible define failures banks like northern rock dexia bankia reminders small medium size banks endanger entire financial system would inherently unstable two supervisory mechanisms banks operating same market.the participation non eurozone countries new supervisory scheme commission proposal confers powers ecb supervision banks eurozone non eurozone countries proposals provide mechanism join voluntary basis submit ecb authority but eu treaties make complicated give these non eurozone countries full voting powers i do see any political problem giving these countries full voice shaping decisions european supervisor but creativity will needed find legally sound fair solution.national supervisors role new system clearly european council decided paradigm shift powers moving ecb
but national supervisors will members board will take key decisions they will prepare implement current negotiations still fine tune roles european national supervisors but ultimate authority must rest ecb.non eurozone eu members do want join single supervisory mechanism these countries expressed concerns about new powers conferred ecb particular they question ecb's voting rights within european banking authority will remain charge developing single rulebook 27 countries eu single market enhancing convergence supervisory practices need find ways preserve fully influence non eurozone countries within european banking authority.democratic accountability ecb new supervisory powers ecb must course maintain its full monetary policy independence despite its new role so key question how addition giving important role european parliament national parliaments play their part overseeing supervisory decisions.timing according some eu countries commission proposal too ambitious enter into force beginning 2013 but effective single banking supervisor prerequisite esm direct recapitalization banks only possibility strong unified supervision will europe position break vicious circle between banks balance sheet weakness sovereign debt thus resolve eurozone crisis.entry into force january 2013 would bring about supervision ecb banks received requested public funding

when bubble burst ecb tried prevent excessive prices returning their equilibrium levels using its printing press promising unlimited coverage investors latest ecb measures just more same course when financial crisis erupted full force 2008 following collapse us investment bank lehman brothers ecb interventions were justified but after global economy started recover during latter part following year ecb moves became increasingly problematic because they enabled countries evade structural reform hindered necessary disinflation southern eurozone countries even halted altogether portugal italy southern europe had succumbed drug cheap credit but when private credit stalled symptoms withdrawal began appear ecb provided replacement drugs instead treating addiction created junkie economies were unable function without fix japan made similar mistake when its property bubble burst 1990 over two decades bank japan flooded economy money near zero interest rates japanese government its part followed such relentless policy deficit spending public debt jumped 67 gdp 246 gdp today latest upward push provided dubious abenomics economic strategy being pursued prime minister shinzo abe government none helped because neither monetary nor fiscal policy substitute structural reform
contrary more keynesian monetarist drugs administered feebler self healing power markets weaker willingness policymakers impose painful detoxification treatments economy populace but worst effects ecb policy may yet come eurozone still sound economies also become credit junkies there already some worrying signs property markets austria germany luxembourg practically exploded throughout crisis result banks chasing borrowers offers loans near zero interest rates regardless their creditworthiness austria property prices risen nearly half since lehman collapse luxembourg they risen almost third even germany europe largest economy been experiencing massive property boom since 2010 average urban property prices having risen more than third nearly half large cities country undergoing construction boom seen since reunification real estate agents only leftovers offer german property boom could reined appropriate jump interest rates but given ecb apparent determination head opposite direction bubble will only grow
bursts effects could dire euro new euro skeptic alternative germany party made astonishing headway country recent state elections would make sure eurozone minsky conundrum brussels stubbornly low inflation european central bank worried but its response essentially just more quantitative easing could backfire exacerbating imbalances generating serious financial instability stands headline consumer price index eurozone hovers around zero even core inflation remains below too far comfort ecb target around while new round weakness global commodity prices earlier year contributed these figures does explain weakness longer term inflation expectations improved little since march when ecb started its massive €60 billion 66.3 billion per month bond buying program but instead rethinking its strategy ecb considering doubling down buying even more bonds lowering its benchmark interest rate even further into negative territory would serious mistake easier credit conditions lower interest rates supposed boost growth stimulating investment consumption demand but core eurozone countries like germany netherlands credit been plentiful interest rates been close zero some time so there was never much chance bond purchases would significant impact there indeed european commission most recent economic forecast shows spending core countries increased result ecb policies germany external surplus actually increasing

recovery already begun eurozone should left run its course even more expansionary monetary policy stance might strengthen recovery marginally but cost increasing eurozone already dangerous imbalances europe chimerical capital markets union london eurozone's survival doubt again greece demands debt forgiveness end austerity else but though europe's currency union risk its banking union remains early stage development endlessly creative european commission embarking another adventure so called capital markets union so called appropriate because project despite being only vaguely defined point most certainly intended create single european capital market indeed european union leaders know better than announce such ambition would require new treaty no prepared open up worms after european voters no mood transfer more powers brussels capital markets union actually began slogan coined eu commission president jean claude juncker's acolytes now new financial markets commissioner united kingdom's lord jonathan hill been assigned unenviable task putting flesh bare bones
commission's green paper consultation round subject produced more questions than answers think tanks lobby groups national regulators wasted no time trying influence hill's efforts head off any initiatives might damage their interests bank england argued there should no replication banking union grant new powers european central bank expense national central banks capital markets union boe argues does require institutional change so no super regulator should created commission accepted conclusion now though hill's aides suggested some point…supervisory issues will pop up fact establishing european version us securities exchange commission longstanding aim brussels eurocracy may achieved day but just yet but before delving into institutional issues favorite topic eu veterans should consider what problem capital markets union supposed solve here there considerable agreement most regulators market participants agree europe's financial markets dysfunctional banking assets amounting roughly 300 eu wide gdp compared some 70 united states large pools savings being left unused
moreover european companies receive excessive 80 their finance banks less than capital markets proportions roughly reversed us need redress imbalance become increasingly evident since recent financial crisis banks efforts rebuild their capital bases meet stricter regulatory requirements led credit rationing loosening constraint output growth would improve european economy's resilience encourage risk taking promote dynamism overall aim capital markets union thus relatively straightforward but achieving no small part because europe's heavy reliance bank finance stems structural cultural factors remedies commission suggested so far example encouraging crowdfunding standardizing terms securitization appear unlikely promote rapid growth non bank finance promoting pan european private placement market might help would aligning standards covered bonds but both strategies would face serious legal obstacles indeed though hill's modest initial agenda certainly would do no harm should pursued quickly possible any substantial measures beyond would confront major roadblocks example harmonizing insolvency regimes across continent reducing tax incentives favor debt over equity while entirely logical strike heart member states remaining sovereignty thus will extremely difficult push forward

brussels new european commission headed jean claude juncker off rocky start but would know reading news headlines sherlock holmes understood dog does bark nighttime usually goes unnoticed europe case european union fiscal rules issue commission principle eu watchdog should bark loudly when they flouted last month howls seemed inevitable after two large eu countries italy france submitted budget plans 2015 clearly violated their governments vows continued austerity first commission dutifully rejected two budgets incompatible rules eu stability growth pact sgp but something happened was curious arthur conan doyle story within days both countries offered mini adjustments their budgets worth about 0.2 gdp their finance ministers wrote commission their budgets should now approved commission did react leaving french italian leaders claim they brussels bureaucrats had last word fact latest forecast reflects even worse outcome france italy year than originally promised france deficit set increase slightly 2015 italy cyclically adjusted deficit expected deteriorate
stability growth pact prescribes annual improvement least 0.5 gdp new commission thus risks losing its authority very start its mandate whether does crucial question because maintaining high degree credibility essential economic policymaking eurozone see why worth recalling sgp original rules were judged stupid former commission president romano prodi because single minded pursuit deficit below gdp could inappropriate during recessions argument was accepted sgp was supposedly rendered more intelligent example permitting budget deficits adjusted economic cycle adding medium term objectives expenditure introducing escape clauses but new rules obviously require strong institution interpret them whose judgment accepted everybody though checking whether budget below sgp ceiling gdp may straightforward matter there reasonable disagreement about whether business cycle adjustment should estimated 0.5 0.8 gdp whether country adhering its medium term expenditure objective commission supposed last word thereby ensuring rules credibility consistency seems lost fight first round could course argue sgp should scrapped because austerity makes no sense when eurozone faces risk deflation but commission fiscally louche member countries should decide
